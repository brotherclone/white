glyph_description: "A spiral intersecting three vertical lines, with a broken circle at the apex. The spiral represents information escaping linear time, the verticals are the prison bars of material reality, and the broken circle is the shattered surveillance apparatus."
glyph_components:
  - "Spiral (escape from linear time)"
  - "Three vertical bars (material prison)"
  - "Broken circle (compromised control)"
  - "Intersection point (moment of breach)"

charging_instructions: "Stare at the sigil while listening to the final mix on repeat until it loses all meaning and becomes pure pattern. At the moment of dissolution, the intent is released into the collective unconscious. Burn the physical representation (if one exists) or delete the digital file after charging. The sigil's power is inverse to your conscious awareness of it."
