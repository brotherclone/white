text: "Four members of local rock band 'The Transmission' failed to return home 
      after a late-night practice session in a cabin near Vernon Woods. Band members, 
      all between ages 17-19, were last seen loading equipment into their van around 
      11:30 PM Tuesday. Police found the cabin unlocked with instruments still set up, 
      but no sign of the youths. Vernon Police Chief Thomas McCarthy said there were 
      no signs of struggle, though neighbors reported hearing 'unusual electronic sounds' 
      around midnight. The band had been experimenting with synthesizers and had spoken 
      about recording 'alien frequencies' for their upcoming demo."
