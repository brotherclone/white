rescue_justification: "Information-substrate compatibility allows ship integration. Material beings cannot be preserved in this form."
rationale: "We preserve what we cannot save. One consciousness expands; the rest become archive. The tragedy is complete."
arbitrary_perspective: "We arrived too late. The anthropocene cascade was already irreversible. All we could do was document."
