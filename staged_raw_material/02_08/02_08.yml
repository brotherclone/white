    description: The song wraps - but... What's this? There's a sample of The Fool singing 'rainbow man' in the background, strangely connecting the dots between the song and Pynchon, who has informed so much of the project.

concept: This song, a sort of a mediation on 'rebracketing', has some odd allusions. It plays with the structure of the song (chorus verse) but then references Neil Young's single note guitar parts as if it was a weaponized thought beam. It ends with a loop from the The Fool's 1968 Rainbow Man - which may or may not be Tyrone Slothop.
