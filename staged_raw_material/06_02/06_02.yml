concept: The was a girl at an in-hospital school my mom taught at. She was the only verbal student and would love when me and my sister could visit. She would hold both our hands - her touch was cold and her skin was blue from lack of circulation. She died shortly after the summer we spent with her. In this alternative timeline she lives a little longer and I visit her hospital room. Dedicated to Stacie
