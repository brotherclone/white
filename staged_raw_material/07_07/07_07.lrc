Look Outside, the sun has gone behind the water tower. All the police have gone home for the day, there's nothing left for them to steal. I know what you fixed to me, tied to a string and dangling out the window. Quick before they come, let it fall down. Let it fall down.

Don't you feel like being the same? Don't you feel like I forgot your name?
I've told you this so many times before, what do you need from me to fix the stitch in the night?

They'll hold back the tickets that we purchased for the drive-in down the street. I know you're excited to see the latest mystery. I'll try to not to spoil it.
I'll try not to explain it. I'll try to not critique it. I'll try to not to notice.

I will only have this phone for another month or two, then I don't know how and I don't know when. Won't you please take it with you, I have no use for its SIM cards, or the fortune cards, or the playing cards, or the sympathy cards for you.
