concept: At the start of the blue album this song sets the tone - it alludes to Walsh's preveious band, Timesbold. And the song's narrative seems like it could fit right in with Ruine - rural, depressive tale of a broken family. However, this isn't the narrator's actual life story - it is parallel timeline run amok in his mind. The song explores themes of self-loathing, regret, and the desire for redemption. The narrator reflects on their past mistakes and the impact they have had on their relationships, particularly with a significant other. The lyrics convey a sense of vulnerability and a longing for forgiveness, as the narrator grapples with their own flaws and shortcomings. Dedicated to version 875.
