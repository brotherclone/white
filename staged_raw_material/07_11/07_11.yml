    description: A secret message
concept: Possibly the most direct song in The Rainbow Table, of course about being indirect. This banger ends Infranyms with the anthemic 'Let them all keep guessing' - It acknowledges a potential listener's frustration with the puzzles and 'gimmicks' but ultimately encourages them to embrace the chaos and keep moving forward regardless.
