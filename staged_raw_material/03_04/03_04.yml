concept: I lived in NYC area for college and for about five years after. For work I made the mistake of moving to the UK for a year. Unbeknownst to me, there's a tax treaty set up specifically between New York and London that made moving back a financial impossibility. When I finally made it back to New York everything had changed. A theater space I used as a landmark had changed it's name from "Here" to "Space" and I wound up texting a friend "It used to be Space, now it's Here." I was lost in my former home and downtown didn't know North from South without the World Trade Center to orient me. The song is about that dislocation and the feeling of being an outsider in a place that used to be home. Although not a favorite song of mine it has one of the best lines I've ever written "Was it across from the (Central) Park, where  John( Lennon) met his Mark( Chapman)? Or off Dekalb Ave (in Williamsburg Brooklyn) where Nicky the Knife (local mobster) got stabbed?" The past thing misremembered was the "Ear" sign/bar being above Canal.
