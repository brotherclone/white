concept: A guys is meeting his ex at pub and they are rehashing their breakup. Although he's invited her here, he gets bored and begins thinking of some childish adventure out of a comic book or saturday morning cartoon about digging up a mystical artifact. The lyrics blur the lines between the two scenarios. The thing forgotten was her tell - not a look but a habit of 'digging' through her food when she's annoyed.
