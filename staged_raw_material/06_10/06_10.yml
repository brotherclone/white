concept: In second grade a boy wanted to fight me and Craig stepped in to defend me. He got his arm pulled out of its socket in the process. He dropped out of school and became a bit of a town boogie man - but still I'd see him walking with a sling. In this world the roles are reversed and he's the wimpy shit and I'm the ghost boy. Dedicated to Craig.
