concept: There were a couple of years where I spent hours in the Copenhagen airport delirious from jet-lag and bored out of my mind while waiting for the plane to Jutland. I began to see the same people over and over like a commuter, I always wanted to talk to them but was too reserved. In this alternative universe it's me who is being characteristically standoffish.  Dedicated to Passenger Jørgensen
