concept: A childhood friend was dying of cancer and told my family that 'Brian watches TV waiting to die' and I thought a lot about that playing Warcraft with my wife's friend who also died of cancer. In this alternate world which I could see so very clearly it was me who played games waiting for the end. Dedicated to Trisch
