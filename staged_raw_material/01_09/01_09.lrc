We are planning to break in this week

while legal bores the red team to sleep

Gapped off, tails up, we are ready for the shriek!

Will you please tell us what you find

while scraping the depths for a sign?

What monsters to root and disable

while sitting at the rainbow table?

Your handle will be etched in the lore

while I got traced dropping off of Tor

I think I hear the windbreakers at my front door
