concept: Like Neo in the Matrix before he takes the pill or Mr. Robot - this is a song about a hacker who has crossed the line and is now in deep shit. I was working for some folks that were not to be messed with at the time and this stoked my latent paranoia. A rainbow table is a list of brute force attacks and became the title of the ten year project The Rainbow Table. The notion that one would be sitting at it, a flowing, tabular code stream, like vikings in a Valhalla feast was both frightening and funny to me
