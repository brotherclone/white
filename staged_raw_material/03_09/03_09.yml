concept: While trying to make a documentary about a concentration camp survivor, we got locked in the inner fortress of Theresienstadt in the Czech Republic. We had to scale the walls to escape through a former minefield. We were lost and trying to our way back to town and felt very alone and disoriented by horror of the place. This song captures that feeling of being lost in a dark and frightening place, with the industrial/metal sound reflecting the harshness of the environment and the panic of being lost. The item lost and misremembered was not a stone taken from the surrealist Robert Desnos memorial but a vile of dirt I gave to Jayson Merritt upon returning.
