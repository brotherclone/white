concept: M.E.E. stands for Mass Extinction Event. The piece is structured around two cycles of life emerging, developing, and diversifying followed by near complete annihilation. The composition draws inspiration from modern classical composers such as Krzysztof Penderecki, Charles Ives, and György Ligeti, incorporating dissonant harmonies, unconventional structures, and experimental soundscapes to evoke the grandeur and fragility of life on Earth.
