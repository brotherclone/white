concept: There's a song by Tom Rush called "Beam Me Up Scotty" that my dad used to play a lot growing up. During this dark era of 2016 I found myself thinking similar thoughts - but Iain M. Banks' Culture instead of Star Trek. The idea of being rescued from the mess humans are making of the planet by a benevolent, highly advanced alien civilization. I tried to share my Culture-inspired music with /r/Culture, but they didn't seem to care for it. What? Did I think I could make friends through music, silly me.
