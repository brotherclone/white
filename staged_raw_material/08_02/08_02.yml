    start_time: '[00:00.000]'

  - section_name: Verse 1
    start_time: '[00:22.015]'
    end_time: '[00:45.004]'
    description: The vocals are an affected male baritone, but not Gabe - it's a commercial version of him and bordering on parody.
  - section_name: Chorus 1
    start_time: '[00:45.005]'
    end_time: '[01:07.019]'
    description: The chorus is an easy transition from the verse to the bridge with a sad and ironic lyric which focuses on the failings of Gabe's creative output.
  - section_name: Bridge 2
    start_time: '[01:07.020]'
    end_time: '[01:30.008]'

    end_time: '[01:52.023]'
    description: The second verse continues the ironic take on Gabe's creative struggles.

    end_time: '[02:38.002]'

  - section_name: Chorus 3
    start_time: '[02:38.003]'
    end_time: '[03:06.008]'
    description: The final chorus is a bit more resigned and more emotional.
concept: A very inside allusion to Fat Albert and The Clash - this song is a focus on one's limitations. The narrator realizes he's done this song before and it sends him into a depressive spiral.
