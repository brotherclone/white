# ToDo: Complete LRC

Beautiful ladies they're solving mysteries on jet skis
Look at them triumph they are everything that's not me
Couch bound I'm dreaming, while they're brightening the TV
You are making me feel like I have no confidence
You are making me feel like I am incompetent
Glamorous heroes, they're uncovering a drug ring
Inside I'm looking for the same daring - there's nothing
You are making me feel all of those dark dead currents
You are making me feel like I am incompetent
