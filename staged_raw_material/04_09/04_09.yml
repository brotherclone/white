concept: The vine infant and the group spill into back into the party, knocking over trays, guests, and furniture. In the chaos you spot a doorway that sticks out for its plainness and the group quickly ducks in while the room is distracted. A beautiful woman with long sparkling eye lashes stands a counter used for coat check. She looks at each of you expectantly and then asks you for your ticket. The group pleads with her for a way out of the Palace, but she only smiles and says "No ticket, no way out." Desperately you search your pockets and bags for anything that might resemble a ticket. You find a crumpled yellow page from a phone book and hold it up to her. She takes it, examines it closely, and then nods and hands you back your coats. "I got you, honey," she says cryptically and produces a green, velvet cloak from beneath the counter. As she unfurls the cloak you can see the night sky in the distance. A thud is heard at the door, the vine infant is on your heels. Quickly the party glances at one and another in agreement and each leaps up on the counter and crawls through the portal in the cloak.
