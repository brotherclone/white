concept: Al Basti is the Sumerian name for Lilith, Adam's first wife who was made from the same earth as he. She was cast out of Eden for refusing to be subservient to him and became a demon who preyed on new mothers and infants. This song is from her perspective, her side really railing against the unfair treatment she received and YWH's unfair treatment of Eve. The song is playful and whimsical in tone, but the lyrics are dark and angry. This is one of many feminist anthems in The Rainbow Table.
