    start_time: '[00:00.000]'
    end_time: '[00:14.081]'
    description: Insanely distorted guitars like shoegaze with LFO modulation blast immediately - underneath we can hear a metronome or clock sound ticking away at 134 bpm.
  - section_name: Intro 2
    start_time: '[00:14.082]'
    end_time: '[00:35.204]'
    description: A bass guitar is added, but it's cheerful and bouncy like a Beach Boys bass. This juxtaposition of the heavy, distorted guitars and the upbeat bass creates a unique tension.
  - section_name: Verse 1
    start_time: '[00:35.205]'
    end_time: '[00:51.234]'
    description: The song shifts with more 60's guitar lines now with a back beat and a Farfisa organ and the vocals begin
  - section_name: Bridge
    start_time: '[00:51.235]'
    end_time: '[01:00.233]'
    description: A little Beatles-ish flourish moves the song into the chorus
  - section_name: Chorus 1
    start_time: '[01:00.234]'
    end_time: '[01:15.054]'
    description: The chorus starts the vocals hanging on the last not and overdubs picking up the next phrase
  - section_name: Angelic Interlude
    start_time: '[01:15.055]'
    end_time: '[01:29.136]'
    description: While the bass continues the rock instrumentation drops and we hear a heavenly female choir. It's a jolting and strange transition.
  - section_name: Verse 2
    start_time: '[01:29.137]'
    end_time: '[01:40.073]'
    description: Back full-scream ahead with the shoegaze guitars and the vocals continue
  - section_name: Garage Punk Interlude
    start_time: '[01:40.074]'
    end_time: '[01:58.051]'
    description: Okay, what is happening? The song veers into a 70s garage punk style with a raw, lo-fi aesthetic. The guitars are more aggressive and the energy is high. The vocals are shrill and snotty.
  - section_name: Verse 3
    start_time: '[01:58.052]'
    end_time: '[02:12.133]'
    description: And back to the neo-shoegaze stuff and if nothing happened.

    start_time: '[02:12.134]'
    end_time: '[02:21.122]'
    description: Some Beatles-y guitar transitions again
  - section_name: Chorus 2
    start_time: '[02:21.123]'
    end_time: '[02:35.204]'
    description: Return to the chorus with similar vocal layering
  - section_name: 1950s Interlude
    start_time: '[02:35.205]'
    end_time: '[03:11.160]'
    description: Another odd shift - as if someone is listening to Buddy Holly and The Spiders from Mars between radio stations. There's snaps and claps and breaking style vocal.
  - section_name: Angelic 1950s Interlude
    start_time: '[03:11.161]'
    end_time: '[03:40.073]'
    description: The previously heavenly boys choir returns but now with a 1950s backing percussion. It's a surreal combination.
  - section_name: Outro
    start_time: '[03:40.074]'
    end_time: '[04:08.237]'
    description: Now here comes everybody, shoegazers, boys choir, garage punks and proto-rockers all jamming together in a glorious cacophony of sound that is both chaotic and strangely harmonious.
  - section_name: An actual bit of cassette
    start_time: '[04:08.238]'
    end_time: '[04:17.114]'
    description: The song ends with a snippet of cassette recording of my actual high school band practicing. It's lo-fi and nostalgic. The stop button snaps and ends the track abruptly.

concept: A nostalgic reflection of my high school band days is re-bracketed in a surreal manner with abrupt genre shifts and eclectic instrumentation. The shoegaze guitars are anachronistic - filtered by LFO, Let It Bleed style boys choir buts up against 70s garage punk and 50s rock and roll. The song is a chaotic yet harmonious blend of these disparate elements, creating a unique soundscape that is both intense and eclectic.
