Know you have been down for weeks

Me too, in waves and peaks

Seems you got yourself a new dog.

Guess I'll Undo that last Epilogue

You moved on, but here I am stuck feeling him gone

Seems you are now quite alright

Too few of my old friends left in sight

You know it's untrue I hold on in spite

Put him down together. I still see him around

You moved on, but here I am still leashed along
