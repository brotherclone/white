concept: The term 'Moonraker' is a colloquialism for the people of Wiltshire and originates from a folk tale about smugglers. There are many communities who lay claim to originating the story but the one we favour is set in Devizes where a group of sixteenth century smugglers were forced to hide their contraband in The Crammer after being surprised by a visit from the excisemen. As a ruse, the smugglers pretended they were attempting to rake a 'cheese' that had rolled into the water. The excisemen, seeing the men were in fact raking the moon's reflection, left the simple country-folk to their labours and rode out of town, unaware that the Wiltshire men were having the last laugh! It is in this spirit that Ruine "misremembers" the past, specifically my early years in rural New Jersey and New York - the past is not forgotten but a memory rebracketed to gain new context and meaning. In such it is an overture to the "orange" album in The Rainbow Table as the word "orange" has evolved phonetically rebracketed and then rebracketed again to blend the object with the color, the map with the territory. In the song we get the first and perhaps most drastic sounds of the 1990s rave and heavy metal scene with the double-kick drum machine pattern. The vocals are ethereal and high-pitched as if trying to rise above the cacophony of sounds. The odd time signatures and shifting tempos are disorienting as if the listener is being taken on a journey through an alien landscape. The "past thing imagined" is of course the smuggler's wheel of cheese.
