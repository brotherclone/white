concept: Around this time I was commuting to work sometimes taking an hour-and-a-half each way. Stuck, in many senses, on the DC's outer loop. While stuck in traffic I imagined throwing my keys out the window and climbing down off the overpass as in 1q84. The song is about that feeling of being trapped but with liberation a step away.
