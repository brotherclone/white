concept: As the world grew more and more alienating I felt as if I was on the periphery of society, an outsider looking
  in. I felt like I was being watched, like there were forces beyond my understanding that were shaping my reality. This
  song is about that feeling of paranoia and alienation, and the desire to break free from it. It's also about obsession
  -  romantically and the obsession with wanting some sort of empowerment through ritualistic behavior. The lyrics are
  filled with references to sigils, which are symbols used in magic and occult practices. The song is about the desire
  to find meaning and power in a world that often seems chaotic and senseless. The lyrics also are a prime example of my
  'constellation' style of writing where a subject is danced around with missing wordplay. For example, 'I've picked up
  the tic of the extra in passing, now the past is staged too' Never says it's about an actor - or feeling like one. 
  Same with 'tricks in the booking' johns/prostitutes at the police station? What information is the narrator trying to 
  get  from them? Whether being a hacker, druggie, occultist, dimensional hopper, or literal alien, the narrator is
  trying to find a way out of their current reality.
