concept: 2016 was a beat down of a year. The election of the fucking orange menace, the continued rise of fascism worldwide, the ongoing refugee crisis, and the general sense that things were getting worse, not better. This song is about resilience in the face of all that. It's about continuing to create, to love, to live, even when the world seems bleak. The lyrics touch on themes of hiding from oppressive regimes, but also of finding strength in community and in art.
