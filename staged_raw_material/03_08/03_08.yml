concept: Hazy memories of 1970s television ads always gave me the creeps. This play on both Mendelssohn's Wedding March and the saccharine pop of The Carpenters is meant to evoke that same feeling of unease and dread. The commercial jingles are reordered to tell the story of child sacrifice and cannibalism. The "mechanical bride" is from Marshal McLuhan's idea of the "mechanical bride" - the way media and technology shape our perceptions and experiences. The thing misremembered was a strange board game add where a disc was overturned and a cookie, like a girl scout thin mint, was revealed. I misremembered it being a Eucharistic wafer.
