concept: Since Light Reading was all about imagined books - I just had to do a cut up style lyric. I wandered around the house, randomly flipping open books and writing down fragments to form the lyrics of this song. The book that the song was based on was a Christain novel one of my dad's students wrote. He was a bit embarrassed of the dedication to the teacher who taught him how to write given the novel's subpar prose.
