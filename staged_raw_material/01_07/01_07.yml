concept: The Real, The Symbolic, and The Imaginary - I had a really dorky dream that there was an ordinance past in congress to label all objects with a nutrition label style tag that explained the object's symbolic meaning and its relationship to the real and imaginary. The song plays on the dazed and confused state of meta-thought.
