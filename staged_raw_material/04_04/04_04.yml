concept: The party, perhaps misdirected, stumbles into a small drawing room where a mentalist named Kilmet is performing for a small audience. Kilmet produces a box containing a disembodied mouth that sings with the voices of a choir. A learned guest suggests that the mind can create such illusions on its own. When some guests express suspicion of trickery, Kilmet opens the box again to show there are no wires or electronics inside. The mouth then speaks a ghostly message - 'In-trud-ers,' prompting the party to quickly exit through a back door.
