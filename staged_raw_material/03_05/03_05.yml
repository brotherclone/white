concept: One of the most directly autobiographical songs, Newton (named for the town in Sussex County, NJ where I grew up - and obviously Rainbow-related) is about the "magical bored" moments of youth. The girl in the song is a composite of friends I spent a lot of time with back then - a couple of which had some mental health issues. Their unknowable inner worlds were something that I both related to and could never get close to. There's touches of drug-use and the casual racism of that area and time. Musically, the song is an extrapolation of the WSUS weather alert jingle - which had a cheesy synth melody that I always found haunting.
