concept: Off the coast of Virginia lies Tangier Island, a small landmass in the Chesapeake Bay. The island is known for its unique dialect, which has been preserved over centuries due to the island's isolation. This community has also been significantly impacted by climate change, with rising sea levels threatening its very existence. Yet, due to their Christain ideology, many residents deny the reality of climate change and perhaps even nihilistically welcome it as a Noah-like flood that will cleanse the world. Their dialect, insular culture and denial of the rising waters plays upon the re-breacketing of the world in a post-climate change era.
