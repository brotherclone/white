concept: While doing meditations I got into the habit of imagining meeting my seventeen year old self across a stream in the woods I would pass my consciousness to him (the sleeve) and try to find a hidden cave entrance that was different every time. Once in the cave I would carve a sigil into the wall and burn it into the rock by tracing the pattern with my eyes. There were three bells that would let me know how much time had passed in the meditation. The thing that was misremember was the long sleeve tshirt I was wearing as the teen. It was blue, not purple as in the meditation. The song is about that experience and the feeling of being out of time and place.
