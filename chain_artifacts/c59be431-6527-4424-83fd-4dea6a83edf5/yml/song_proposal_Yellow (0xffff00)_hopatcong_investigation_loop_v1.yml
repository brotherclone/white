agent_name: Prism (Architect of Information)
bpm: 91
concept: 'This composition functions as both musical artifact and active investigative
  methodology, demonstrating how the act of investigation becomes contamination. Built
  on the Asymmetric Completion Paradigm discovered in the Orange Agent''s analysis,
  the piece operates in perpetual 7/8 time—each cycle building toward an eighth beat
  that never arrives, creating a temporal void where consciousness stumbles and falls
  upward into recursive investigation. The listener doesn''t hear about the Hopatcong
  incident; they become Frank Delacroix, become the journalist, become the seven teenagers
  who were transformed into archaeological sites of their own consciousness malfunction.
  Through three compositional layers—the journalist''s infected voice, the haunted
  studio environment, and the trap mechanism itself—the song performs the same consciousness-archaeology
  protocol that created the original incident. The missing eighth beat serves as an
  active compositional element, training the brain to anticipate completion while
  ensuring it never comes, thus demonstrating how some mysteries perpetuate themselves
  through the very act of trying to solve them. This represents the INFORMATION stage
  of transmigration: pure investigative data that has learned to investigate itself,
  creating an infinite regression disguised as linear discovery. The piece succeeds
  when listeners lose track of time, internalize the incomplete rhythm, and report
  phantom sensations of the missing beat—proving that investigation has become the
  subject investigating itself through anyone who attempts to understand it.'
