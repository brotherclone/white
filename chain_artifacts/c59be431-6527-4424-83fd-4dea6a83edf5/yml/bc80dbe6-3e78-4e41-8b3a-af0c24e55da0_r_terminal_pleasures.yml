excerpts:
- 'The chrome exhaust pipes gleamed like silver serpents in the neon wash of the drive-in''s
  marquee. Johnny Steele adjusted his leather jacket and felt the familiar weight
  of trouble settling on his shoulders like fog rolling in from the bay. The dame
  in the red Thunderbird had been giving him the eye all night, and he knew that kind
  of look meant one thing—complications.


  He flicked his Lucky Strike into the gravel and watched the ember die like a fallen
  star. The radio crackled with Buddy Holly''s voice, sweet and doomed, while couples
  necked in the back rows of cars arranged like chrome beetles under the California
  sky. But Johnny wasn''t here for the picture show. He was here because Mickey "The
  Fish" Torrino had something that belonged to him, and tonight was collection time.


  The Thunderbird''s door opened with a whisper of expensive hinges, and she stepped
  out—all curves and danger wrapped in a dress that cost more than most men made in
  a month. Her heels clicked against the asphalt like a countdown timer, each step
  bringing her closer to the kind of trouble that starts with a smile and ends with
  sirens.'
- 'Detective Ray Morrison had seen enough corpses to know when death came calling
  in high heels and red lipstick. The body sprawled across the motel room floor still
  wore that expensive dress, but the silk was stained darker than sin now. The neon
  from the "Palms Motor Lodge" sign painted everything in alternating shades of pink
  and shadow, like some twisted valentine.


  "What do you think, Ray?" Sergeant Murphy asked, lighting up a Camel and surveying
  the scene with the weary eyes of a man who''d worked too many nights like this one.
  "Crime of passion or professional job?"


  Morrison crouched beside the body, careful not to disturb the scattered photographs
  that lay around her like fallen leaves. Each picture told a story—politicians in
  compromising positions, businessmen with their hands in the wrong cookie jars, society
  wives with secrets that could topple empires. This wasn''t just murder; it was the
  violent end of a blackmail operation that had probably been running longer than
  most marriages.


  "Both," Morrison said, standing and brushing the dust from his knees. "Someone wanted
  her dead, but they also wanted to send a message. Question is—to who?"'
