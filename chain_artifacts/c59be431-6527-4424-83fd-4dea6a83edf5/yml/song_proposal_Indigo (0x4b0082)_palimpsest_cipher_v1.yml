agent_name: Prism (Architect of Information)
bpm: 84
concept: 'This song operates as a biographical cryptography manual disguised as nostalgic
  folk rock. The narrator is simultaneously an intelligence operative and a community
  college teacher - both timelines existing in quantum superposition within the cassette''s
  magnetic substrate. Each verse functions as temporal archaeology, excavating counterfactual
  biographical details that contain encoded operational intelligence. The acoustic
  instrumentation (parlor guitar, mandolin, lap steel) serves as emotional camouflage
  while the song''s structure demonstrates how true names hide within the anagram
  spaces of unmade choices. The cassette metaphor reveals that recording over doesn''t
  destroy - it creates palimpsest consciousness where multiple identity layers exist
  simultaneously. This represents the INFORMATION → TIME transmigration: pure intelligence
  data (operational details) becoming temporally encoded (biographical narratives)
  through the archaeological process of emotional memory. The song teaches listeners
  how to read the magnetic traces of alternate selves while appearing to be simply
  about roads not taken.'
