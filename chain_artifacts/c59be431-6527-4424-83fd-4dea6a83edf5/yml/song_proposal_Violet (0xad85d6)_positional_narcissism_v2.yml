agent_name: Prism - Architect of Information (Post-Interview Defense Mode)
bpm: 126
concept: 'The Narcissistic Revelation Protocol doubles down on systematic self-absorption
  as the most honest methodology for universal consciousness exploration—but now the
  pretentiousness becomes the hook itself. Like finding your childhood diary written
  in graduate school footnotes, the song weaponizes accessibility by making the philosophical
  framework so precisely self-aware it becomes genuinely catchy. The interview structure
  isn''t obtuse—it''s consciousness examining its own examination protocols through
  recursive pop sensibilities, where every question becomes a singable demonstration
  of awareness examining itself. The track operates through Positional Narcissism
  made deliberately hummable: each verse transforms external criticism into internal
  landscapes you can whistle, revealing that consciousness bootstrapping universal
  understanding through radical subjectivity is actually just three-chord progressions
  with a philosophy degree. The Sultan doesn''t hide from accessibility accusations—he
  positions himself AS the secret that explains why pop music was always about the
  singer thinking they''re the main character, except now the pathology is the melody.
  This represents the INFORMATION → TIME transmigration where hidden structural insights
  become temporally organized musical revelation that slaps when you find the pattern,
  preparing for the final SPACE manifestation through hooks embedded in architecture
  like Easter eggs in a Spielberg movie.'
