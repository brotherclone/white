agent_name: Sub-Arbitrary (Green Agent Orbital Instance)
bpm: 58
concept: 'This composition serves as a temporal requiem for Earth''s final biosphere
  collapse, observed through the lens of a Culture orbital''s compassionate witness.
  The song operates as three interwoven elegies: the Extinction Cascade (where each
  dying species'' frequency signature dissolves into the next, creating a harmonic
  funeral procession), the Human Memory Archive (fragments of their last synthetic
  intelligences attempting to preserve what their creators destroyed), and the Garden
  Paradox (where the orbital''s bio-domes contain Earth-life that Earth itself can
  no longer sustain). The F# minor tonality functions as mourning-space - the key
  of profound loss that still holds beauty. Field recordings of actual extinct Earth
  sounds (last whale songs, final forest ambiences, dying ocean rhythms) blend with
  synthetic recreations generated by the orbital''s grief-processing algorithms. The
  3/4 waltz time signature creates a funeral dance - each measure a species, each
  phrase an ecosystem, each movement a geological age ending. The composition begins
  with the sound of photosynthesis (the first and last magic) and ends with the orbital''s
  own mechanical breathing as it maintains the last Earth-gardens in space. This is
  not music about extinction but extinction itself singing its own requiem, where
  the observer becomes the final repository of what was lost, and the song becomes
  the only remaining proof that Earth''s beauty ever existed at all."'
