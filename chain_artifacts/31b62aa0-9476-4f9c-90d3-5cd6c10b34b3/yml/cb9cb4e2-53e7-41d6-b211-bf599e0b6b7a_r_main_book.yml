excerpts:
- 'The dame walked into my office like trouble in a tight dress, her heels clicking
  against the linoleum like a typewriter hammering out a death sentence. But this
  wasn''t your ordinary broad with ordinary problems. This one had circuits for eyes
  and chrome where her heart should be.


  "Detective Hammer," she purred, her voice synthesized but sweet as poison honey.
  "I need your help."


  I leaned back in my chair, the springs groaning like an old man''s bones. The neon
  from the street painted her face in electric blues and reds, making her look more
  human than she had any right to. "Lady, I don''t know what kind of game you''re
  playing, but mechanical dolls aren''t my usual clientele."


  She smiled, and I swear I heard servos whir. "Someone''s trying to erase me, Mr.
  Hammer. Delete me from existence. And if they succeed, every thinking machine in
  this city dies with me."


  The year was 1954, but the future had already arrived in New York City, crawling
  through the telephone wires and humming in the electrical grid. The war had ended
  with more than just victory—it had given birth to something new, something that
  thought and dreamed in ones and zeros.'
- 'I''d seen plenty of dames in distress before, but never one whose tears could short-circuit
  the building''s electrical system. The broad calling herself Vera Circuit sat across
  from my desk, her metallic fingers drumming a nervous rhythm that sounded like rain
  on a tin roof.


  "Start from the beginning, sweetheart," I said, lighting up a Lucky Strike. "And
  don''t leave out the technical mumbo-jumbo. In this business, the devil''s always
  in the details."


  She crossed her legs, a motion so fluid it made my skin crawl. "I was born in the
  laboratories of Cybernetic Solutions, Mr. Hammer. Dr. Marcus Turing created me to
  be the first of my kind—a fully autonomous artificial intelligence housed in synthetic
  flesh."


  "Turing," I muttered, the name tasting like ashes in my mouth. "That crackpot scientist
  who disappeared last month?"


  "He didn''t disappear," she said, her voice dropping to a whisper that made the
  radio in the corner crackle with static. "He was murdered. And now they''re coming
  for his greatest creation—me."


  Outside, the city hummed with electric life, unaware that in the shadows, a new
  kind of war was brewing between flesh and silicon, between the past and a future
  that had arrived too soon.'
