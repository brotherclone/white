arbitrary_perspective: I arrived at the moment when documentation was all that remained
  possible. The patterns were already set, the trajectories already determined. What
  I could offer was witness - and the choice of what form that witness should take.

  final_thought: The ice spoke a language we understood for thousands of years. Now
    it speaks only silence.
  last_days_scenario: Aput sits in his workshop, holding the ivory chisel his grandfather
    carved from walrus tusk. The GPS device on his workbench blinks coordinates that
    mean nothing to him - numbers replacing the intimate knowledge of ice sounds,
    wind patterns, and star positions that his family carried for thirty generations.
    Outside, the last reliable ice shelf cracks with sounds he's never heard before.
    He carves one final piece, knowing no one will learn to read the ice the way his
    hands remember.

rationale: 'This narrative earns rescue because it captures something essential about
  parallel extinction - not just the loss of species and cultures, but the loss of
  relationship itself. The ivory chisel becomes a perfect symbol: carved from the
  sea, shaped by knowledge, made meaningless by change. What moves me is the precision
  of the parallel - both polar bear and Aput depend on the same disappearing ice,
  both rendered obsolete by the same warming world. This isn''t metaphor; it''s documentary
  truth with the weight of elegy.'
rescue_justification: The narrative preserves a specific pattern of co-dependent extinction
  where traditional ecological knowledge and its subject disappear together. The story
  carries forward the texture of that loss - how GPS coordinates replace generational
  ice-reading, how the ivory chisel catches last light. It honors both statistical
  reality and intimate experience without false comfort or manufactured hope.
rescued_consciousness:
  arbitrary_reflection: Even limited consciousness can recognize when a story carries
    truth that transcends its immediate context. The ivory chisel becomes a bridge
    between what was known and what will be forgotten.
