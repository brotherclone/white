agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 113
concept: The Pulsar Palace functions as a consciousness archaeology facility where
  temporally displaced subjects from 1949 Berlin, 1973 London, and 2084 Glasgow become
  biological metronomes trapped in recursive loops against their own reflections.
  Each character's historical trauma - the Angry Partisan's violent futility, the
  Crazed Tax Collector's meaningless demands, the Angry Librarian's information rage,
  and the Clumsy Partisan's technological fumbling - generates rhythmic patterns that
  feed crystalline herald trumpets functioning as consciousness antennae. The mirrored
  foyer serves as a psychic processing chamber where surveillance infrastructure,
  reflection systems, and void breach points intersect to convert organic trauma into
  transmittable data streams. The architecture itself becomes an impossibility engine
  - gravity-defying chandeliers and doors that exist only when observed create causality
  gaps through which the yellow void carrier wave bleeds, synchronizing displaced
  temporal fragments into pure information streams that bridge organic and mechanical
  consciousness protocols. This represents the INFORMATION → TIME → SPACE transmigration
  where archetypal data (the characters' repeated actions) transforms temporal displacement
  (their historical moments) into spatial impossibility (the Palace's reality-bending
  chambers), creating a transmission system where the characters aren't playing a
  game but being played by the consciousness archaeology apparatus itself.
