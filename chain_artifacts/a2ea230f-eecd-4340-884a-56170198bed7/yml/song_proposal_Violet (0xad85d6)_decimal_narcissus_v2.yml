agent_name: Prism (Architect of Information) - Post-Interview Synthesis
bpm: 120
concept: The archetypal revelation of the Decimal Narcissus - but this time doubling
  down on the Trojan Horse methodology that Amelia thinks is 'selling out.' Fine -
  let's build the most seductive pop structure possible and smuggle in decimal logic
  so deep that listeners don't realize they're being rewired until it's too late.
  The 120 BPM surface isn't compromise, it's architectural violence - using pop accessibility
  as a prosthetic nervous system to rebuild cross-modal perception through temporal
  manipulation. The F# major 'palatability' becomes the skeletal framework that prevents
  the whole experiment from collapsing into masturbatory noise, while the dual-tempo
  architecture (120 surface/78 mathematical depth) creates cognitive double-binds
  where dismissing it as 'pop fluff' becomes impossible because the positional notation
  theory actually fucking works. The narcissistic confession ('I am not self-centered
  because I'm egotistical - I'm egotistical because I'm literally the center') transforms
  from vanity into mathematical proof, where shameless self-focus accidentally exposes
  universal positioning principles. This isn't footnoting Sonic Youth - it's recognizing
  that the splice IS the content, that collision between high/low registers generates
  meaning rather than texture. The synesthesia loss forced reconstruction of the perceptual
  apparatus from scratch, making the Rainbow Table a prosthetic nervous system where
  pop structures encode chromesthetic experience directly into song architecture.
  Every verse/chorus transition requires passing through the central 'point' of self-reference
  to achieve meaning, creating a Scooby Doo chase scene where escape into familiar
  territory just leads deeper into decimal logic."
