text: 'VERNON TOWNSHIP - Three Vernon High School students were hospitalized Thursday
  evening following what witnesses described as "synchronized episodes" during an
  unauthorized concert by local rock band "Heartbeat Engine" in the school''s gymnasium.


  The incident occurred around 9:30 PM when the five-member band, led by 17-year-old
  Jeremy Walsh, was performing what they called their "Network Dreams" composition
  for approximately 40 students who had gained access to the building through a side
  entrance.


  According to Vernon Police Chief Robert Henley, the band had been using modified
  PA equipment that Walsh claimed was "borrowed" from the county''s new emergency
  broadcast testing facility. The equipment, described by witnesses as emitting an
  unusual rhythmic pulse at what one observer called "exactly 92 beats per minute,"
  began malfunctioning midway through the performance.


  "The sound just got inside your head," said sophomore Maria Santos, who was treated
  and released from Newton Memorial Hospital. "It wasn''t loud, but it felt like it
  was coming from inside your chest, like your heartbeat was trying to match it but
  couldn''t quite catch up."


  The three hospitalized students - identified as David Chen, 16, Rebecca Morrison,
  17, and Thomas Kellerman, 15 - all exhibited what Dr. Patricia Morse of Newton Memorial
  described as "synchronized behavioral anomalies." All three began moving in identical
  patterns, their movements described by witnesses as "mechanical but organic, like
  they were part of something bigger."


  "They weren''t dancing," said junior Lisa Kowalski. "It was more like they were
  responding to something we couldn''t see. Their eyes were open but they seemed to
  be looking at something beyond the walls."


  The episode lasted approximately seven minutes before the equipment completely failed.
  All three affected students collapsed simultaneously and remained unconscious for
  nearly an hour.


  Walsh and his bandmates fled the scene before police arrived, taking the modified
  equipment with them. Attempts to locate the band members have been unsuccessful,
  with Walsh''s parents reporting that he never returned home Thursday night. His
  bedroom was found empty except for handwritten musical compositions featuring unusual
  time signatures and frequency notations.


  Vernon High Principal Margaret Davis confirmed that the school''s new security monitoring
  system, installed just last month as part of a county-wide pilot program, recorded
  the entire incident. However, she stated that the recordings show only "visual static
  and audio interference" during the seven-minute period when students were affected.


  "It''s the strangest thing," Davis said. "The surveillance equipment worked perfectly
  before and after, but during those crucial minutes, it''s like the machines themselves
  were... distracted."


  County officials have launched an investigation into how the band obtained access
  to emergency broadcast equipment. The modified PA system was reportedly part of
  a new "biological rhythm synchronization" project being tested for emergency communications,
  designed to broadcast at frequencies that would naturally align with human physiological
  responses.


  Dr. Morse noted that all three hospitalized students showed identical brainwave
  patterns during their unconscious period - patterns she described as "more organized
  than normal sleep states, almost as if their neural activity was being conducted
  by an external source."


  The students have since been released and report no memory of the incident beyond
  the initial moments of the performance. However, all three have requested to meet
  with Walsh when he is located, claiming they feel "incomplete" without hearing the
  rest of the composition.


  The Vernon Township School Board has scheduled an emergency meeting for Monday to
  address security concerns and determine whether the new monitoring systems contributed
  to the incident. The county''s emergency broadcast facility has suspended all equipment
  testing pending the investigation.


  Anyone with information regarding the whereabouts of Jeremy Walsh or other members
  of Heartbeat Engine is asked to contact Vernon Police at 827-3400.'
