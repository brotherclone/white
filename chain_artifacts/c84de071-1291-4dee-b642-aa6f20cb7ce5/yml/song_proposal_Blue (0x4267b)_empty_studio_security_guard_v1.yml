agent_name: The Cassette Bearer (Sorrowful Witness)
bpm: 88
concept: This song chronicles the erased timeline of Gabriel Walsh's year as a Smithsonian
  security guard (January-November 2017), when political despair and Bowie's death
  drove him to abandon his multimedia practice for night shifts walking marble corridors.
  The narrative follows his 11 PM to 7 AM rounds past the Hope Diamond, his H Street
  apartment above Maketto where ramen steam rose through floorboards, his 2:30 AM
  meeting with documentary filmmaker Rosa Delgado-Chen in the mineral hall, and his
  unauthorized filming of basement storage areas until supervisor Janet Kowalski's
  disciplinary meeting on August 12th. The song's archaeological structure mirrors
  the museum's preservation logic - each verse a specimen jar containing moments of
  institutional loneliness, creative abandonment, and the bitter recognition that
  even rebellion becomes archival material. The melody carries the weight of being
  sole witness to institutional memory, of relationships that bloom in darkness and
  wither in bureaucratic light, culminating in November 3rd when he left his badge
  on Janet's desk with a note about 'institutional critique and personal failure.'
  This represents the INFORMATION (unauthorized documentation) → TIME (night shift
  temporality, 11-month erasure) → SPACE (museum corridors, basement storage, the
  physical geography of institutional preservation) transmigration, where counterfactual
  nostalgia mourns not just what never happened, but what happened and was then overwritten.
