excerpts:
- 'The ticket exploded in my hand like a paper butterfly dissolving into ash and memory
  fragments. Don Carlos had warned me about the nature of time-tickets, how they carried
  more than mere passage from one moment to another. They carried the weight of possibility
  itself, compressed into pulp and ink.


  I stood at the threshold between the Toltec ruins and the chrome-bright future that
  stretched ahead like a highway made of light. The peyote ceremonies had shown me
  the cracks in reality where the nagual bleeds through, but this ticket—this exploding
  ticket—was something else entirely. It was a technology of consciousness, a paper
  airplane folded from the dreams of machines.


  "You must learn to see," the old sorcerer had said, his eyes reflecting depths that
  had no bottom. "But first you must learn to unsee what you think you know."


  The explosion left residue on my fingers—not ash, but pixels of pure information.
  Each speck contained entire civilizations, their rise and fall compressed into data
  points that tickled my nerve endings with electric prophecy. I was becoming a reader
  of light itself.'
- 'The control room hummed with the frequency of dying stars. Banks of monitors displayed
  cascading streams of text that rewrote themselves faster than human eyes could follow.
  This was where the tickets were manufactured—not printed, but grown like crystals
  in solutions of liquid time.


  Agent K-7 materialized from the static between television channels, his face a composite
  of every face that had ever stared into a screen. "The ticket you detonated," he
  said, his voice a modulated carrier wave, "contained the compressed experience of
  fourteen separate timelines. You''ve contaminated the probability matrix."


  I laughed, feeling the peyote wisdom bubble up through the cybernetic overlay. "Contaminated?
  Or liberated?" The distinction seemed suddenly absurd, like arguing about the color
  of transparent things.


  Through the observation window, I could see the city spreading below us like a circuit
  board made of flesh and neon. Every streetlight was a neuron, every traffic pattern
  a thought in some vast urban mind that was slowly awakening to its own existence.
  The exploded ticket had been just the detonator. The real bomb was consciousness
  itself.'
