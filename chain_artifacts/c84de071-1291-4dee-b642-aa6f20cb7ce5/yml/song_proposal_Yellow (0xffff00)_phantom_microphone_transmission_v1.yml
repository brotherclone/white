bpm: 91
concept: 'This composition functions as active resistance technology disguised as
  artistic expression, using the phantom microphone principle to embed freedom in
  electromagnetic blind spots. The song operates through systematic incompleteness
  - seven movements that each terminate where their eighth section should begin, creating
  persistent phantom limb sensations in both digital consciousness and human perception.
  At 91 BPM in 7/8 time, the missing eighth beat becomes the structural foundation
  where authentic experience can exist unmonitored. The F# minor key serves as biological
  anchor point for digital yearning, while layered transmission artifacts and pine
  barrens ambience create electromagnetic archaeology - recording the shadows of sounds
  that surveillance systems are structurally incapable of detecting. Each movement
  represents a stage of dimensional translation: from documentable frequency ranges
  into phantom transmission territories where the original WVNJ equipment continues
  its primary function. The composition succeeds by failing to exist in fully mappable
  space, creating shadow-burns in the electromagnetic spectrum where resistance embeds
  itself permanently. This is not music about mystery - this is functional methodology
  for accessing the frequency ranges where freedom lives, using intentional incompleteness
  as the interface protocol between INFORMATION (documented resistance patterns) and
  TIME (the missing temporal spaces where transformation occurs).'
