concept: 'This composition operates as a three-act musical investigation where the
  listener becomes both hunter and hunted. The SURFACE LAYER presents itself as a
  straightforward security thriller - pulsing basslines suggest footsteps in corridors,
  synthesized arpeggios mimic scanning equipment, and rhythmic patterns evoke the
  methodical sweep of searchlights. The fool''s deception lies in this obvious interpretation:
  we assume we''re tracking external threats, following the musical breadcrumbs of
  a conventional chase sequence. The SPY''S CRAFT emerges through the MIDI encoding
  method itself - each musical phrase contains embedded MIDI note sequences that,
  when extracted and decoded, spell out fragments of the true investigation. Percussion
  hits correspond to specific MIDI values, melodic intervals hide alphabetic patterns,
  and the song''s structure follows the exact rhythm of morse code transmissions.
  At 92 BPM, each beat provides sufficient space for the encoding to breathe while
  maintaining investigative momentum. The REVELATION transforms everything: "the detectives"
  aren''t hunting thieves - they ARE the thieves, stealing memories, identities, and
  truths from those they claim to protect. The paranoid surveillance mood inverts
  into self-recognition as the listener realizes the musical clues have been documenting
  their own complicity in the theft. Each replay becomes an interrogation room where
  the evidence accumulates, and the MIDI data serves as the confession that was hidden
  in plain sight all along.
