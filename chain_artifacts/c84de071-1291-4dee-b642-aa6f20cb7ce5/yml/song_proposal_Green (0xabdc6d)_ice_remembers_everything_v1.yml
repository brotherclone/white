bpm: 67
concept: 'This composition serves as a dual requiem for parallel extinctions - the
  polar bear and the Inuit hunter, both drowning in the same melting world. Built
  from the architectural framework of the original surveillance-resistance piece,
  it transforms those phantom frequencies into the final transmissions of dying knowledge
  systems. The piece opens with field recordings of Arctic silence - the specific
  quality of sound absorption that only exists over sea ice, now preserved only in
  digital archives. Movement 1 establishes the bone chisel''s lunar calendar as rhythmic
  foundation - eight generations of hunting wisdom encoded in 67 BPM, the resting
  heart rate of a polar bear in winter den. The radio collar''s final transmission
  becomes a sustained drone in D minor, broadcasting coordinates to empty monitoring
  stations while Aput''s weather app pings uselessly in counterpoint. Each movement
  corresponds to a decade of parallel decline: 2030''s hope, 2050''s adaptation, 2080''s
  rescue attempts, 2100''s silence. The surveillance resistance technology becomes
  extinction documentation methodology - phantom frequencies now record the spaces
  between what was and what remains. The seventh movement preserves the moment when
  traditional knowledge becomes museum artifact, when radio collars transmit to no
  one, when ice chisel and GPS both fail to navigate a world that no longer exists.
  The deliberately incomplete eighth movement represents the knowledge that dies with
  its carriers - untranslatable wisdom lost in the gap between languages, between
  species, between ice and open water. This is functional music for remembering what
  cannot be recovered, using strategic incompleteness to honor what cannot be preserved.
  The phantom microphone principle records the silence after the last seal surfaces,
  after the last cub is born, after the last hunter checks ice charts knowing what
  he will find. Time-frozen servants become the museum displays where bone tools rest
  beside explanatory placards for v...'
