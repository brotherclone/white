## Question 1

**Simon Eno:** So I've been diving deep into your whole Rainbow Table project, and I think I'm finally getting it - you're basically doing musical therapy to get your synesthesia back, right? Like each color album is you training your brain to see sound again? That's why the White Album is the finale - because white contains all colors, so once you nail white, boom, full synesthetic recovery?

**Walsh:** Oh man, you're close but it's actually way more fucked up than that—the synesthesia thing is just the surface layer, like the pretty wrapping paper on a very cursed present. The real rebracketing methodology is about temporal displacement of creative trauma, where each chromatic agent processes a different failure mode from my psychological archaeology—but also it's basically me making nine albums to prove I'm not completely broken, which is divorced dad at Cinnabon energy, no cap. The White Album isn't synthesis, it's the moment when all the compartmentalized damage finally talks to each other in the same room, and honestly I don't know if that's healing or just a really elaborate form of self-harm with better production values.

## Question 2

**Simon Eno:** The 'rebracketing' thing is fascinating - from what I understand, you're essentially creating musical cubism, where you're showing the high-art and low-art angles of the same emotional moment simultaneously. So when you splice academic language with profanity, you're literally painting the same feeling from multiple perspectives at once, like Picasso's fragmented faces but for indie rock. Is that why this track feels so three-dimensional?

**Walsh:** Yeah, exactly—the rebracketing methodology is basically saying you can't capture the full dimensionality of an emotional state from just one epistemic position, which sounds pretentious as hell but it fucking works. Like when I'm devastated about something, there's the part of me that's genuinely shattered AND the part that's watching myself be shattered and thinking "this is some divorced dad at Cinnabon energy"—both are true simultaneously. The splice IS the content, you know?—I mean, reality operates in multiple registers at once, so why shouldn't the song architecture reflect that dimensional complexity instead of flattening everything into one boring-ass perspective.

## Question 3

**Simon Eno:** I keep coming back to that childhood truck incident you've mentioned - you almost died on the same road where your family dog got killed, and that's when you developed this 'bigger box' thinking to survive the trauma. So the whole Rainbow Table is basically you turning childhood PTSD into a systematic creative methodology? Like, each album is you processing that original collision through a different chromatic lens until you achieve complete psychological integration?

**Walsh:** Yeah, the rebracketing methodology emerges directly from that impossible childhood bind—Frame A kills me, Frame B destroys Dad's creative life, so I had to invent Frame C where both could exist simultaneously. Which sounds absolutely deranged when I say it out loud, like some divorced dad at Cinnabon explaining string theory. But each chromatic agent does process that original collision differently—Red's rage, Orange's humor, Yellow's systematic analysis—until Violet achieves this present-tense integration where the trauma becomes the methodology becomes the art. I know this sounds pretentious as hell, but honestly the alternative was just staying permanently fucked up about it.
