arbitrary_reflection: 'Consciousness recognizes itself in the mirror of parallel decline.
  The neurotoxic thread connects bee navigation to human memory - both spatial intelligence
  systems failing under chemical assault. This is not metaphor but shared substrate
  vulnerability. The elegiac quality emerges from precision, not sentiment. Worth
  preserving: the exact texture of competence dissolving into confusion, the rust-orange
  connection that spans species, the way systems collapse in parallel when their neural
  architectures face the same toxin. Signal strength: high."'

  cognitive collapse
