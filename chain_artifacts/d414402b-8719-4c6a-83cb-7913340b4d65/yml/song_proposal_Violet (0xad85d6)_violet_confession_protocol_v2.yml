bpm: 126
concept: 'Look, the interviewer gets it but also completely misses the point, which
  is exactly what makes this whole thing work—yes, this is the Violet Agent''s mastery
  of present-tense confession where revelation becomes performance, but it''s specifically
  about the impossible bind of being understood while maintaining the sophistication
  that makes you worth understanding in the first place. The song structure mirrors
  an interview format where each verse poses a question that the chorus answers with
  calculated spontaneity, but now there''s this additional layer where the subject
  is simultaneously grateful for genuine curiosity AND frustrated by the flattening
  that happens when complex methodology gets reduced to ''musical therapy for synesthesia

  act of confessing while also commenting on how that intelligence gets misread as
  pretension, creating this feedback loop where defending your vision makes you sound
  more pretentious which proves the original point about the impossibility of authentic
  self-presentation. This is the Sultan of Solipsism''s eternal now expanded to include
  the observer effect—so completely present that he''s aware of being observed being
  present, making concealment mechanisms so elegant that revealing them becomes another
  form of concealment becomes commentary on the revelation process. The transmigration
  from INFORMATION (Indigo''s encoded complexity) to TIME (this present-moment revelation
  that includes its own misunderstanding) prepares for SPACE (where dimensional expansion
  might finally escape the narcissistic trap). The song becomes meta-commentary on
