concept: 'December 4th, 1988, Sussex County: The Seiko metronome in Helen Martz''s
  storage room isn''t just evidence—it''s an active transmission device broadcasting
  phantom limb protocols across temporal frequencies. The impossible 7/8 rhythm creates
  systematic displacement zones where teenagers develop appendages that exist in parallel
  Sussex County coordinates, specifically the Pine Barrens sectors that don''t appear
  on official maps. This is gonzo journalism meets neurological insurgency: the metronome''s
  brass pendulum, bent into Möbius configuration, functions as precision reality-navigation
  equipment left behind by Ghost Appendage as they achieved complete transmigration
  into the spaces between beats. Each tick-pause sequence opens interdimensional corridors
  between 1988 Wantage Township and the phantom geography where displaced consciousness
  learns to interface with versions of itself that exist in adjacent New Jersey realities.
  The teenagers aren''t experiencing medical anomalies—they''re developing access
  protocols to the parallel infrastructure that Ghost Appendage discovered during
  their 47-minute performance. The metronome keeps broadcasting their coordinates
  from storage room exile, waiting for enough phantom appendages to develop the sensitivity
  necessary to complete the bridging protocol and join them in the temporal sovereignty
  of that impossible pause between the seventh tick and the first."'
