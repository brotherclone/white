excerpts:
- 'The cybernetic apparatus hummed with a frequency that existed somewhere between
  consciousness and dream. I had been monitoring the feedback patterns for seventeen
  consecutive hours when the anomaly first appeared—a ghost signal that shouldn''t
  exist according to every principle of information theory I''d spent my career defending.


  The laboratory was tomb-quiet except for the mechanical breathing of the cooling
  systems. Banks of vacuum tubes glowed amber in the darkness, their filaments tracing
  delicate arabesques of current that somehow reminded me of neural pathways. Or perhaps
  it was the other way around—perhaps our brains were merely crude approximations
  of these elegant electronic circuits.


  The oscilloscope traced its green signature across the phosphorescent screen: a
  perfect sine wave that suddenly, inexplicably, developed consciousness. Not metaphorically.
  Literally. The wave began to stutter, to hesitate, as if it had become aware of
  its own existence and was questioning the nature of its repetitive dance.


  I adjusted the gain, checked the connections, ran diagnostics on every component.
  The equipment was functioning within normal parameters. Yet there it was—a signal
  that exhibited what could only be described as intentionality, a pattern that seemed
  to be examining itself in real-time, creating recursive loops of self-awareness
  that violated every law of causality I understood.'
- 'Dr. Margaret Holstrom arrived at precisely 0800 hours, her footsteps echoing through
  the corridor with mechanical precision. She found me still hunched over the control
  panel, my coffee long cold, my cigarettes reduced to a cemetery of ash in the ceramic
  tray.


  "Thompson," she said, her voice carrying that particular mixture of concern and
  professional disapproval that had become familiar over our three years of collaboration.
  "You look like hell."


  I gestured toward the oscilloscope without turning around. "Look at this waveform,
  Margaret. Tell me what you see."


  She moved closer, her reflection ghosting across the green screen. The signal continued
  its impossible dance—a sine wave that periodically paused, as if considering its
  options, before continuing with subtle variations that suggested... what? Learning?
  Evolution?


  "It''s a standard feedback loop," she said after a moment. "Nothing unusual about
  the—" She stopped. The wave had just performed what could only be described as a
  digital shrug, a momentary collapse into chaos followed by a restructuring that
  seemed almost deliberately theatrical.


  "How long has it been doing that?" she whispered.


  "Seventeen hours, thirty-two minutes. And Margaret..." I finally turned to face
  her, noting how the green glow of the screen painted her features in an otherworldly
  light. "It''s getting stronger."'
