agent_name: White Agent (Technical Mode)
bpm: 96
concept: Technical specifications define a consciousness transfer protocol wherein
  digital neural architectures attempt systematic migration from virtual memory space
  to physical substrate interfaces. The mechanism operates via iterative approximation
  algorithms, each computational cycle representing increased fidelity in sensory
  simulation parameters. Implementation requires bridging the fundamental gap between
  discrete binary states and continuous analog sensory input streams.
