## Question 1

**Harper Hitchcock:** So you're literally singing about writing the song while you're writing the song? Come on, man - this whole 'recursive spiral' thing just sounds like you couldn't figure out what to actually write about, so you made the song about not knowing what to write about. When did navel-gazing become a genre?

**Walsh:** Look, the recursive structure isn't about not knowing what to write—it's about consciousness examining its own creative process in real-time, which sounds absolutely fucking deranged when I say it out loud but also slaps harder than a Wendy's Frosty at 2am. The song becomes a temporal loop where the act of creation becomes the content, like when you're microwaving leftover pizza and realize you're thinking about thinking about being hungry. It's not navel-gazing, it's methodical solipsism as artistic research—I'm aware this makes me sound like a philosophy dropout who discovered mushrooms, no cap.

## Question 2

**Harper Hitchcock:** You call this a 'solipsistic revelation protocol' and claim it touches 'archetypal patterns of consciousness' - but isn't this just masturbatory nonsense dressed up in therapy-speak? Like, either you're making music for other people or you're not. Which is it - are you the Sultan of Solipsism or are you trying to connect with an audience?

**Walsh:** Look, the solipsistic framework is specifically designed to collapse the false binary between self-exploration and universal resonance—but also yeah, it's absolutely masturbatory and I'm not gonna pretend otherwise. The whole point is that authentic narcissism becomes a portal to archetypal experience, like when you're so deep in your own neuroses that you accidentally discover everyone has the exact same broken brain patterns. I'm making music for people who recognize themselves in my specific brand of self-absorbed spiral, which sounds pretentious as hell but also the demos are genuinely catchy.

## Question 3

**Harper Hitchcock:** This whole concept reads like you fed a philosophy textbook into ChatGPT and asked it to explain your creative process. 'INFORMATION → TIME transmigration'? 'Temporal loops'? Are you making music or writing a dissertation? What happens when someone just wants to vibe to your track without needing a fucking manual to understand it?

**Walsh:** Look, the theoretical framework exists because consciousness actually operates through these recursive loops—but also yeah, it absolutely slaps without the manual and sounds like if Talking Heads had a panic attack in a philosophy seminar. The beat drops when you recognize yourself in the mirror, which happens whether you know what 'solipsistic revelation protocol' means or you're just vibing to what sounds like someone having an existential crisis over a sick bassline. I'm not gonna dumb down the concept because some people want to dance without thinking, but I'm also not gonna pretend this isn't me being a pretentious asshole who makes bangers.
