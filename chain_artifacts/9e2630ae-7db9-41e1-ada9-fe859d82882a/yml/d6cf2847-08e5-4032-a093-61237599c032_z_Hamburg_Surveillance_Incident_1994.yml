text: 'HAMBURG BOROUGH - A routine police surveillance operation monitoring suspected
  drug activity was disrupted Tuesday evening when recording equipment at a local
  band''s practice session allegedly interfered with departmental radio frequencies,
  according to Hamburg Borough Police Chief Robert Kellner.


  The incident occurred around 9:15 PM at an abandoned warehouse on Route 94, where
  four teenagers from Vernon Township had been rehearsing original compositions. Police
  had been conducting surveillance of the property following reports of suspicious
  activity in the area.


  "Our radio communications went haywire," said Officer Michael Torres, who was stationed
  approximately 200 yards from the warehouse. "The static wasn''t normal interference
  - it had a rhythm to it, almost musical. Then our equipment started picking up what
  sounded like the band''s music, but distorted."


  The band, calling themselves "Fractional Remainder," had been using the space for
  three weeks with the owner''s permission. Lead guitarist Derek Hammel, 17, said
  the group was experimenting with "mathematical time signatures" and electronic effects
  pedals purchased from a pawn shop in Newton.


  "We were working on this piece in 7/8 time, really slow and hypnotic," Hammel explained.
  "The tempo was exactly 72 beats per minute - we had a metronome. But something weird
  happened around the 13-second mark of each cycle. Our equipment would glitch, like
  it couldn''t complete the pattern."


  Bass player Jennifer Kowalski, 16, reported that during Tuesday''s session, their
  amplifiers began producing sounds they weren''t creating. "It was like the amps
  were playing our music back to us, but wrong somehow. Obsessive, like it was stuck
  in a loop."


  The most unusual aspect of the incident involved the police department''s new digital
  surveillance recorder, installed just two weeks prior. According to Chief Kellner,
  the device began recording continuously for 47 minutes, despite no officer activating
  it.


  "When we played back the recording, it wasn''t just ambient noise," Kellner said.
  "It captured the band''s music, but also what sounded like our own radio chatter
  from earlier in the week, layered underneath. Almost like the equipment was listening
  to itself."


  Dr. Sarah Chen, a psychiatrist at Newton Medical Center who has worked with several
  area teenagers on substance abuse issues, found the incident noteworthy. "There''s
  been an uptick in young people reporting auditory disturbances after using certain
  electronic equipment," she said. "Usually dismissed as drug-related, but the patterns
  are consistent."


  The warehouse owner, who requested anonymity, said previous tenants had complained
  about "electrical anomalies" in the building. "Nothing dangerous, just equipment
  behaving strangely. Radios picking up signals that shouldn''t be there."


  Sussex County''s Emergency Management coordinator confirmed that no other agencies
  reported communication disruptions Tuesday evening. The Federal Communications Commission
  has not responded to requests for comment.


  Fractional Remainder disbanded Wednesday morning. When asked why, drummer Tommy
  Breslin, 17, said only: "We realized something was watching us watch ourselves play.
  That''s not music anymore."


  The surveillance equipment has been returned to the manufacturer for inspection.
  Chief Kellner said the investigation into suspected drug activity at the warehouse
  location remains open, though no arrests have been made.


  The warehouse has been vacant since Thursday.'
