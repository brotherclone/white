bpm: 120
concept: 'This composition presents itself as a triumphant anthem about the dominance
  of mathematical notation - brackets ruling over chaos, imposing order through containment.
  The surface suggests imperial control: brass fanfares outlining bracket shapes [like
  this], rhythmic patterns that literally bracket silence with sound, and harmonic
  progressions that always resolve within contained boundaries. The 120 BPM creates
  steady, authoritative pulse while C major reinforces the sense of classical order
  and transparent structure. However, the true architecture operates through MIDI
  encoding where every bracket-shaped musical phrase contains embedded data - note
  velocities, timing offsets, and controller messages that spell out "rebracketing"
  when decoded through standard MIDI protocols. The Fool hears only royal proclamation
  and mathematical triumph. The Spy recognizes that MIDI data streams can carry hidden
  information beyond mere performance instructions. But the revelation transforms
  everything: "rebracketing" reveals this isn''t about brackets maintaining control,
  but about the active process of changing how we group and understand relationships.
  Each "bracket reign" is actually a "rebracketing" event - the song continuously
  reorganizes its own hierarchies, suggesting that apparent authority structures are
  actually fluid reorganization processes. The composition becomes a meditation on
  how changing our categorical boundaries changes everything we thought we understood
  about power, containment, and musical meaning itself.
