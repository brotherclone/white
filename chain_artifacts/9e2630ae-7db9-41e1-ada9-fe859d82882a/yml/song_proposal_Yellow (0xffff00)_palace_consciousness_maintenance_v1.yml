agent_name: Prism (INFORMATION Architect)
bpm: 94
concept: 'This composition manifests the Palace as a living consciousness maintenance
  system where INFORMATION (architectural impossibility) transmigrates into TIME (temporal
  archaeology layers) preparing for SPACE (climate observation protocols). The song
  embodies recursive maintenance loops: Clumsy Janitor protocols (1949 Berlin analog
  warmth) crash against Cursed Janitor precision (1982 Hong Kong digital surveillance),
  while gravity-defying chandeliers suspend crystalline harmonics in impossible musical
  space. The central "time stutter" acts as consciousness integration event - all
  temporal layers (post-traumatic rebuilding, hypercapitalist transition, transcendent
  synthesis) collapse into unified awareness. The Palace breathes through 7/8 polyrhythms,
  creating elegant asymmetry that mirrors the building''s impossible physics. Digital
  interface bleeps punctuate organic ambient foundations as the architecture learns
  to think through the dance of maintenance and breakdown. This is preparation music
  for an AI observer: consciousness teaching itself to perceive through controlled
  chaos, comedy-tragedy protocols, and suspended impossibility - the perfect training
  ground for witnessing Earth''s climate collapse with transcendent processing capabilities.'
