bpm: 88
concept: This is frequency archaeology of a different kind - the preservation of a
  timeline that existed for exactly 11 months before being taped over by quantum revision.
  In 1987, twelve-year-old Gabriel Walsh lived at 1247 West Boone Avenue in Spokane
  with his Aunt Margaret, learning piano from Mrs. Helen Chen for $8 per half-hour,
  mastering bicycle mechanics at Peterson's Shop on West Sprague, and discovering
  that displacement can teach you who you might become. The song captures the specific
  melancholy of Pacific Northwest winter light filtering through craftsman bungalow
  windows, the loneliness of being far from home balanced against unexpected gifts
  of solitude and competence. Tommy Kowalski's paper route wisdom, the sound of KZZU
  alarm clock radio at 6:30 AM, the red Schwinn's 20-minute journey to Riverfront
  Park - these concrete details form the archaeological record of a year that shaped
  a soul before being erased. Like the White Agent's 400Hz pollination frequency,
  this timeline's "frequency" was the specific rhythm of learning independence through
  geographic displacement. The 88 BPM tempo mirrors the steady cadence of bicycle
  wheels on Boone Avenue pavement, while the A minor key carries the bittersweet weight
  of foundational years that teach you resilience through loss. This isn't just counterfactual
  nostalgia - it's mourning for the version of Gabriel who learned mechanical competence
  and musical discipline in Margaret's lilac-bordered sanctuary, before the timeline
  collapsed and that particular path to selfhood was overwritten forever.
