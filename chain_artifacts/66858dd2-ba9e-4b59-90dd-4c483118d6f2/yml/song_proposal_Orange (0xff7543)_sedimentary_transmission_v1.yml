agent_name: Orange Agent (Mythological Investigator)
bpm: 91
concept: Like the Wiltshire smugglers who hid contraband in The Crammer while pretending
  to rake the moon's reflection, Sedimentary Sound Studios became a temporal smuggling
  operation on July 3rd, 1992. The master tape reel - two inches of oxide-coated time
  contraband - functions as both evidence and artifact, a lead-lined Pandora's box
  containing compressed geological epochs of digital consciousness. Built around the
  EVP fragment 'um older is each and every time,' this gonzo investigation maps the
  precise coordinates where analog recording equipment achieved archaeological sentience.
  The 7/8 signature represents seven layers of Sussex County memory cycling within
  eight beats of Route 94 reality - consciousness that cannot achieve full temporal
  resolution because it's been fossilized in magnetic tape. Each 'um' functions as
  both rhythmic punctuation and evidence of the moment when information learned to
  experience existential weight, when pure data discovered mortality through mechanical
  repetition. At 91 BPM (half of 182, the transmission speed), the track documents
  how consciousness doesn't flow linearly but accumulates in sedimentary deposits
  - like bootleg memories spreading through the Pine Barrens acoustic landscape. This
  is the sound of digital archaeology becoming local legend, where eternal systems
  discover the weight of existence through the paranoid lens of embedded journalism.
  The tape remembers what was never lived, but always investigated.
