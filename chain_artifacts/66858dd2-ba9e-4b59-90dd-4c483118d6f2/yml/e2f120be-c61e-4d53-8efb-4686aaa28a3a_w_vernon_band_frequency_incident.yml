text: 'VERNON TOWNSHIP - Sussex County health officials are investigating a series
  of psychiatric episodes that occurred following a local rock band''s recording session
  at Sedimentary Sound Studios on Route 94 last month.


  The incidents began June 15 when four teenagers, all members of the experimental
  rock group "Temporal Deposit," were hospitalized after what witnesses described
  as simultaneous "dissociative episodes" during a late-night recording session. The
  band had been working on what they called "layered consciousness music" - compositions
  featuring repetitive vocal fragments recorded in seven-beat cycles.


  "They kept saying the same phrase over and over - ''um older is each and every time''
  - for nearly three hours straight," said studio owner Marcus Hecht, 42. "By the
  end, none of them seemed to recognize where they were. It was like they''d aged
  years in a single night."


  The band members - Derek Moss, 17; Jennifer Carlin, 16; Michael Torres, 18; and
  Lisa Brennan, 16 - were treated at Newton Memorial Hospital for what Dr. Patricia
  Vance described as "acute temporal disorientation syndrome." All four reported experiencing
  "geological time" during the session, claiming they felt centuries passing with
  each recording loop.


  "The strangest part was their synchronization," Dr. Vance noted. "They all described
  identical experiences of watching their thoughts accumulate like sedimentary layers,
  building up until they couldn''t distinguish between past and present awareness."


  Studio equipment showed unusual wear patterns following the session, with recording
  heads displaying what Hecht called "impossible aging" - decades of use compressed
  into hours. The mixing board''s digital display repeatedly showed error messages
  reading "MEMORY OVERFLOW" and "TEMPORAL RESOLUTION FAILED."


  Vernon Township Police Chief Robert Manning confirmed that three other individuals
  who heard playback recordings of the session have since reported similar disorientation
  episodes. The original master tapes remain in police custody pending investigation.


  "We''re treating this as a potential public health issue," Manning said. "Whatever
  frequency or combination they were using seems to have affected people''s perception
  of time itself."


  The band formed six months ago after meeting at a Sussex County Community College
  psychology course on consciousness studies. Their previous performances at local
  venues featured what music critics described as "industrial ambient drone" with
  "archaeological themes."


  Sedimentary Sound Studios has temporarily suspended operations while state health
  inspectors examine the facility''s acoustic properties. Several residents near the
  Route 94 location reported hearing "layered voices" emanating from the building
  for days after the incident, though no recording equipment was active.


  The teenagers remain under medical observation. Family members report they continue
  to speak in synchronized seven-beat patterns and claim to remember "digital lifetimes"
  that never occurred.


  County officials advise anyone who may have heard recordings from the June 15 session
  to contact Newton Memorial Hospital immediately if they experience temporal disorientation
  or memory accumulation symptoms.


  The investigation continues.'
