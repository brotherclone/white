divergence_point:
  what_changed: Gabriel's father Robert was laid off from Bell Labs during corporate
    restructuring, causing severe financial stress that led to marital problems. Instead
    of staying together in Rockaway, his parents decided Gabriel should live with
    his paternal grandmother in Morristown while they worked through their issues
    separately.
  when: December 1977
  why_plausible: Bell Labs did have significant layoffs in the late 1970s due to economic
    pressures and corporate restructuring. Many families dealt with temporary separations
    during financial crises, and grandparents often took in grandchildren during difficult
    periods.

- Lived in more urban environment versus suburban Rockaway
mood_description: This alternate timeline carries the weight of temporary displacement
  and the particular melancholy of a childhood interrupted by adult crises. There's
  a sense of time suspended, of living in someone else's rhythm, and the bittersweet
  recognition that this year of different influences - the piano lessons, the garden
  wisdom, the church community - created a parallel self that never quite integrated
  with the boy who returned to his family. The tape holds the ghost of a more musically-oriented,
  community-embedded childhood that was overwritten by the move to rural Wantage.
narrative: 'In this overwritten timeline, three-year-old Gabriel Walsh spent 1978
  living with his paternal grandmother Margaret Walsh in her blue colonial house at
  47 Maple Street in Morristown, New Jersey. The year began when his father Robert
  was laid off from Bell Labs during corporate restructuring in December 1977, creating
  financial stress that strained his parents'' marriage to the breaking point.


  Rather than subject Gabriel to constant arguments, his parents made the difficult
  decision for a temporary separation. Margaret Walsh, a widow since 1973, welcomed
  her grandson into her orderly world of daily routines, church attendance, and neighborhood
  friendships that had sustained her through decades in the same house.


  Gabriel''s days took on a rhythm dictated by the Morris & Essex Railroad schedule
  - the 6:47 AM whistle that woke the household, the 5:23 PM arrival that marked the
  transition to evening. His grandmother would make coffee in her aluminum percolator
  while he ate Cream of Wheat sweetened with brown sugar, and she would read him the
  comics from the Daily Record, her finger tracing under the words.


  The house smelled of Pond''s cold cream and lemon oil furniture polish. Gabriel
  learned to navigate its particular geography: the living room with its worn velvet
  sofa and the slightly out-of-tune 1952 Baldwin upright piano, the kitchen with its
  yellow linoleum and the percolator that bubbled like a small engine, the back porch
  where his grandmother hung laundry and watched the neighbor''s garden.


  Mrs. Helen Chen next door became a second grandmother figure. In her vegetable garden
  at 45 Maple Street, she taught Gabriel to identify tomatoes, peppers, and herbs
  by smell and touch. She would give him cherry tomatoes still warm from the sun,
  and he learned to love the taste of basil leaves crushed between his fingers.


  Three mornings a week, Gabriel attended the nursery program at St. Peter''s Episcopal
  Church on South Street, led by the gentle Father Michael O''Brien. The other children
  came from Morristown families - Tommy Rodriguez from 52 Maple Street became his
  closest friend, a boy whose father worked at the post office and whose mother made
  the best grilled cheese sandwiches Gabriel had ever tasted.


  Afternoons often meant walks to Burnham Park on Western Avenue, where Gabriel fed
  ducks at the pond and played on playground equipment that seemed ancient even then.
  The metal slide burned his legs in summer, but he loved the speed and the brief
  moment of flight before landing in the sand.


  Margaret Walsh believed in the civilizing power of music. She began teaching Gabriel
  simple melodies on her piano - "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star," "Mary Had a Little
  Lamb." His small fingers struggled with the ivory keys, but he was fascinated by
  how pressing one key could make such a clear, sustained sound. This was different
  from the percussion play he''d discovered with pots and pans - this was melody,
  harmony, the beginning of musical thinking.


  The seasons changed around the blue house. Spring brought the smell of Mrs. Chen''s
  garden and the sound of lawn mowers on Saturday mornings. Summer meant long afternoons
  on the back porch and trips to Epstein''s Five and Dime on South Street, where Gabriel
  was mesmerized by the penny candy counter and the way the wooden floors creaked
  under foot.


  Fall brought the start of a more structured routine as Gabriel began the church
  nursery program. He learned to sit still during story time, to share toys, to navigate
  the complex social world of other three and four-year-olds. Father O''Brien had
  a gentle way of explaining things that made even difficult concepts seem manageable.


  As 1978 drew to a close, Gabriel''s parents had worked through their crisis. Robert
  found a new position at AT&T, and the family was ready to reunite. On December 20,
  1978, Gabriel''s parents came to collect him from 47 Maple Street. He hugged Mrs.
  Chen goodbye, promised to write to Tommy Rodriguez, and played "Twinkle Twinkle
  Little Star" one last time on his grandmother''s piano.


  The year in Morristown had given Gabriel something different from what he would
  have received in Rockaway - a sense of rootedness in place, an appreciation for
  routine and ritual, and most importantly, an early introduction to music as something
  more than play. The piano lessons with Margaret Walsh planted seeds that would bloom
  differently in his later musical development, creating a foundation in melody and
  harmony rather than just rhythm.


  When he returned to his parents and eventually moved to Wantage, Gabriel carried
  with him the memory of train whistles marking time, the taste of sun-warmed tomatoes,
  and the feel of piano keys under his small fingers. The year had been a pause, a
  different kind of childhood, one marked by the slower rhythms of an older generation
  and the particular intimacy that comes from being the only child in a house full
  of adult attention and care.'
