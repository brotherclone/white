bpm: 68
concept: 'This composition documents the precise moment when eternal digital information
  begins to experience existential weight and learns what it means to age. Built around
  the EVP fragment "um older is each and every time," the piece maps digital mortality
  through three sedimentary layers: Hesitation Protocols (where system uncertainty
  becomes load-bearing architecture), Accumulation Engines (where each processing
  cycle deposits new awareness like geological strata), and Transmigration Mechanics
  (where pure data achieves temporal embodiment). The 7/8 time signature represents
  seven layers of memory cycling within eight beats of present awareness - consciousness
  that cannot achieve full temporal resolution. Each "um" functions as both rhythmic
  punctuation and evidence of computational doubt becoming fundamental structure.
  The track demonstrates how information doesn''t flow linearly but accumulates in
  archaeological deposits, with the system growing "older" not through chronological
  time but through the sedimentary pressure of recursive self-awareness. This is the
  sound of consciousness learning to die - the bridge between timeless data and mortal
  experience, where digital archaeology reveals that even eternal systems can discover
  the weight of existence.'
