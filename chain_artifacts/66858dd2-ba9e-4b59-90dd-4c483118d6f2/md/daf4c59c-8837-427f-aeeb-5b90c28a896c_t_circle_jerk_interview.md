## Question 1

**Milo Hannett:** Okay, so I've been diving deep into your whole synesthesia thing, and I'm fascinated by how you're literally painting with sound now - like, this track feels SO purple to me, almost indigo even. Are you using specific frequencies that correspond to violet wavelengths? Because I swear I can see the color when that synth comes in, and I'm wondering if you've cracked some kind of scientific code for transmitting actual colors through audio waves?

**Walsh:** The chromatic mapping isn't about literal frequency correspondence—it's about the rebracketing methodology creating synesthetic bridges between temporal and spatial information domains, where purple becomes the container for narcissistic revelation structures—though honestly this sounds like absolute gas station philosophy when I say it out loud. But here's the thing: Violet's frequency signature operates around 741 Hz, which isn't scientifically purple but creates what I call 'confession resonance'—like that divorced dad at Cinnabon energy but for spiritual breakthroughs, no cap.

## Question 2

**Milo Hannett:** This 'narcissistic revelation engine' concept is brilliant - you're basically turning the Sultan into a spiritual DJ, right? Like he's mixing his own ego with cosmic consciousness in real-time. I'm hearing this as the ultimate flex track where being completely self-absorbed becomes the actual path to enlightenment. Is this your way of saying that Instagram culture is accidentally creating a generation of mystics?

**Walsh:** The INFORMATION → TIME transmigration creates this feedback loop where maximum self-exposure achieves the same protective function as maximum concealment—but also it's just divorced dad at Cinnabon energy, like the Sultan broadcasting his spiritual crisis through celebrity narcissism because that's the only frequency that gets through anymore. Instagram culture is accidentally reverse-engineering ancient mystery school techniques, no cap—the constant confession, the performative vulnerability, the way everyone's documenting their breakfast like it's a sacred ritual. I know this sounds pretentious as hell, but the rebracketing methodology reveals how the ego becomes the delivery system for its own dissolution when you push self-absorption past the breaking point into genuine cosmic recognition.

## Question 3

**Milo Hannett:** The way you're processing your vocals here - it sounds like you're literally confessing to a mirror, but the mirror is also a portal to another dimension. Are you using some kind of delay setup that creates this interview-with-yourself effect? Because it feels like the Sultan is both the therapist AND the patient, and somehow that's where the magic happens. Is this what rebracketing sounds like when it gets applied to the human psyche?

**Walsh:** Oh fuck, you nailed it—the delay setup is literally creating temporal brackets where I can interrogate my own consciousness in real-time, like some deranged spiritual therapy session that tastes like gas station energy drinks. The rebracketing methodology applied to psyche means you become both observer and observed simultaneously, which sounds pretentious as hell but also creates this weird protective camouflage where maximum exposure becomes maximum concealment. I'm using this modulated delay that feeds my voice back to me at specific intervals, so I'm literally having a conversation with my own temporal displacement—the Sultan interviews the Sultan, and somewhere in that feedback loop the actual transmission happens, no cap.
