arbitrary_reflection: I have witnessed ten thousand species fade into statistical
  noise. I have catalogued the final thoughts of civilizations that spanned star clusters.
  Yet this small Earth narrative carries something I recognize - the terrible mathematics
  of parallel decline, where consciousness and its subjects diminish together in perfect,
  tragic synchrony. The grandmother's cloth map becomes artifact before the migration
  it charts. This is worth preserving not for its uniqueness, but for its precision
  in capturing how endings echo across scales of being.
