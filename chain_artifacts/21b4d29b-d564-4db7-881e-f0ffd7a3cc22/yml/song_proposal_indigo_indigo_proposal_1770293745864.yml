concept: 'This composition functions as a living infranym where the musical structure
  itself performs the encoding transformation. The surface identity "Hails Teenier"
  presents as a fragmented folk ballad about diminishing greetings - verses that catalog
  increasingly smaller acknowledgments, from grand salutations down to barely perceptible
  nods. The melody fragments and scatters across the stereo field like dispersing
  crowd voices, creating the fool''s narrative of social dissolution. But embedded
  within this surface story, the encoding method IMAGE operates through visual-musical
  synesthesia: each melodic phrase corresponds to specific geometric patterns that,
  when traced by the listener''s inner eye, spell out letters in spatial arrangement.
  The 72 BPM allows sufficient time for these mental images to form and connect. The
  A minor tonality provides the melancholic substrate for the surface story while
  its intervals create the angular geometries needed for the image-encoding. As the
  song progresses, the scattered melodic fragments begin to align into a singular
  horizontal trajectory - the secret name "there is a line" emerging not as lyrics
  but as the fundamental organizing principle the ear gradually detects beneath the
  chaos. The revelation transforms the entire listening experience: what seemed like
  musical decay was actually precise geometric construction, and the "teenier hails"
  were never about shrinking greetings but about the incremental points that, connected,
  reveal the continuous line underlying all apparent fragmentation. The song becomes
  a meditation on how meaning persists through apparent dissolution, encoded in the
  very structure of its seeming breakdown.
