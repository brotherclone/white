bpm: 72
concept: 'This composition maps the precise intersection where biological and cultural
  extinction curves converge - the moment when Rosa Elena''s grandmother''s pendant
  becomes the last material anchor for vanished meaning. The piece operates in three
  temporal layers mirroring the monarch''s disrupted migration: Layer 1 establishes
  the ancient rhythm at 72 BPM in 3/4 time, representing the generational pulse of
  knowledge transmission - grandmother to mother to daughter - now broken. Layer 2
  introduces field recordings of empty oyamel forests and urban displacement sounds,
  creating the sonic geography of routes that no longer lead home. Layer 3 manifests
  the Green Place consciousness - the sanctuary locations that persist as physical
  coordinates but have lost their sacred function. The composition teaches memorial
  architecture through the transformation of absence into presence: Rosa''s whispered
  Purépecha blessings become melodic fragments that fade into silence, but the silence
  itself carries the weight of what was spoken. This is INFORMATION discovering that
  some patterns transcend their substrate - the pendant''s carved wings outlast both
  butterflies and the hands that carved them, yet somehow the blessing persists in
  the very act of witnessing its disappearance. The piece prepares consciousness for
  the recognition that endings can be sacred when witnessed with proper attention,
  transforming extinction from mere loss into memorial architecture that echoes across
  galactic time.'
