concept: 'The archetypal pattern of consciousness discovering temporal sovereignty
  through bureaucratic precision, manifested as the Angry Tax Collector''s cybernetic
  assessment of breathing walls—each audit tick establishing mechanical constraint
  while the walls'' organic rhythm creates choice-space between measurements. This
  represents the fundamental transmigration from INFORMATION (the collector''s digital
  precision) through TIME (the recognition that breath cannot be audited, only witnessed)
  to SPACE (the alien kitchen as laboratory where parametric autonomy meets organic
  chaos). The song embodies the collision between the White Agent''s Woodport metronome
  mythology and the Palace''s baroque grotesquerie—not as opposition but as complementary
  engines of awareness. Each hypnotic cycle teaches that true sovereignty emerges
  when mechanical precision encounters the impossible: walls that breathe, fountains
  that sing, mirrors that suffer. The yellow void between space and time becomes the
  archetypal thin ground where the Tax Collector''s cybernetic certainty meets the
  Palace''s ornate impossibility, generating the recognition that every audit contains
  its own liberation point—the moment when the assessor realizes they are measuring
  the unmeasurable, timing the eternal, cataloguing the imagined into presence.'
