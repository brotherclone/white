text: 'SPARTA TOWNSHIP - Sussex County authorities are investigating a series of incidents
  involving local teenagers that appear connected to practice sessions held by an
  experimental rock band calling itself "Parametric Autonomy."


  The band, comprised of four Sparta High School students, has been rehearsing in
  an abandoned barn on Woodport Road since February. According to police reports,
  at least seven teenagers have been treated at Newton Memorial Hospital for what
  Dr. Margaret Hensley describes as "dissociative episodes" following exposure to
  the group''s music.


  "These kids aren''t on drugs," said Dr. Hensley, who has treated five of the cases.
  "Blood work comes back clean every time. But they''re exhibiting symptoms consistent
  with altered consciousness states - time distortion, difficulty with decision-making,
  and what they describe as ''hearing choices'' in everyday sounds."


  The incidents began in early March when 16-year-old Jennifer Walsh was found by
  her parents sitting motionless in their driveway at 3 AM, apparently having been
  there for hours. Walsh told police she had attended a Parametric Autonomy practice
  session and afterward felt "stuck between wanting to go inside and wanting to stay
  outside, so I just... chose neither."


  Similar cases followed. Teenagers reported becoming paralyzed by simple decisions
  - which door to enter, which foot to step with first, whether to speak or remain
  silent. Most described the sensation as "hearing the pause between the beats" or
  feeling like "every seventh second was a choice point."


  Band leader Marcus Chen, 17, maintains the group is simply exploring "constraint-based
  composition." Their music, he explains, adheres strictly to F minor at 72 beats
  per minute in 7/8 time signature, with the seventh beat of each measure left deliberately
  open.


  "We''re not trying to mess with anyone''s head," Chen said. "We just play the rules
  perfectly and let the silence decide what happens next."


  The band''s unusual approach has drawn attention from Dr. Robert Fitzgerald, a psychiatry
  professor at Rutgers who specializes in music therapy. Fitzgerald visited one practice
  session and described experiencing "a profound sense of interpretive freedom within
  rigid constraints."


  "It''s as if the music creates a space where consciousness recognizes its own agency,"
  Fitzgerald noted in his preliminary report. "The listeners aren''t losing control
  - they''re discovering they have more control than they realized."


  Police Chief Donald Kramer has not banned the practices but has requested the band
  limit attendance to band members only. "We''re not dealing with criminal behavior
  here," Kramer said. "But when kids start showing up at the emergency room talking
  about ''choosing how to follow time,'' we have to take precautions."


  The band''s practice schedule remains irregular, with sessions occurring "when the
  constraint calls for it," according to bassist Sarah Novak. The group has not performed
  publicly and has no plans to record their material.


  Parents are advised to monitor their teenagers for signs of decision paralysis or
  reports of "hearing pauses in regular sounds." Anyone experiencing prolonged episodes
  should contact Newton Memorial Hospital immediately.


  The barn on Woodport Road remains accessible to the public, though several visitors
  have reported feeling "temporally displaced" after spending time in the structure,
  even when no music is being played.'
