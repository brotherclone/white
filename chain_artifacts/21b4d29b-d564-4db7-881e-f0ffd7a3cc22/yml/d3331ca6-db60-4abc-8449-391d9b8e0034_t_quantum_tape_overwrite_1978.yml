divergence_point:
  what_changed: Instead of staying with his nuclear family during their marital crisis,
    3-year-old Gabriel was sent to live with his Polish great-aunt Margaret in Philadelphia
    for nearly a year
  when: January 1978
  why_plausible: Extended family care during parental separation was common in working-class
    families of the 1970s, especially when grandparents or great-aunts could provide
    stability

following_events:
- Parents reconciled and moved to Wantage together as a family unit
- Gabriel retained fragments of Polish language and cooking smells
- Developed lifelong attachment to urban environments and row house architecture
- Never fully explained the 'missing year' to friends in later life
key_differences:
- Lived in urban Philadelphia instead of suburban New Jersey
- Exposed to Polish-American working-class culture
- Developed earlier independence and street awareness
- Formed deep attachment to elderly caregivers rather than peers
- Experienced temporary family dissolution and reunion
mood_description: The tape carries the weight of a different kind of loneliness—not
  the forest solitude that shaped the actual Gabriel, but the urban anonymity that
  might have created a different artist entirely. There's a melancholy here for the
  Polish lullabies never learned, the city rhythms never internalized, the working-class
  resilience never absorbed. The mood is thick with the smell of pierogi and the sound
  of distant trains, a bittersweet ache for the grandmother-figure who offered unconditional
  love during family chaos, and the particular sadness of a child who learned too
  early that home is temporary, that love can be interrupted by adult decisions beyond
  his control.
narrative: "The quantum tape hisses with the ghost of another life—one where the family\
  \ fracture of 1978 sent young Gabriel not to the woods of New Jersey, but to the\
  \ narrow streets of Philadelphia's Port Richmond neighborhood. \n\nIn this timeline,\
  \ Margaret Kowalski's row house at 2847 Richmond Street becomes the universe entire.\
  \ The wallpaper roses in the kitchen witness a different kind of personality emergence—not\
  \ the forest-child who would run wild behind suburban houses, but an urban observer\
  \ who learned to read the city's rhythms from a third-floor window.\n\nEvery morning\
  \ at 6:30, Stanley Kowalski's work boots announce the day against kitchen linoleum.\
  \ Margaret, seventy-three and still strong, lifts Gabriel onto the wooden step stool\
  \ so he can watch her hands work dough into pierogi. The radio plays Polish folk\
  \ songs from WPTP, and he learns to hum along without understanding the words—melody\
  \ as his first foreign language.\n\nThe sensory architecture is entirely different\
  \ here. No forest smells, no suburban silence. Instead: the rumble of the Broad\
  \ Street subway beneath Richmond Street, the call of the knife-sharpener's truck\
  \ on Tuesdays, the sound of Mrs. Helen Novak's Slovak mixed with broken English\
  \ as she leans over the shared fence to slip him peppermint candies.\n\nFather Murphy\
  \ from St. Adalbert's becomes a weekly presence, his voice echoing in the cavernous\
  \ church where Gabriel sits transfixed by the stained glass St. Cecilia, patron\
  \ saint of musicians. The colored light patterns will haunt his visual memory forever—blues\
  \ and golds that urban sunlight creates, so different from the green-filtered forest\
  \ light he never experienced.\n\nOn June 23rd, he wanders too far into Fairmount\
  \ Park and is lost for three hours until park ranger Thomas Mitchell finds him sitting\
  \ by the Schuylkill River, drawing train cars in the dirt with a stick. This becomes\
  \ his first real memory of fear—not the comfortable fear of dark woods, but the\
  \ vast anonymous fear of a city that doesn't know your name.\n\nThe year shapes\
  \ him differently. He learns independence not through forest exploration but through\
  \ navigating corner stores, understanding which neighbors are safe, reading the\
  \ subtle signs of urban danger and comfort. His drawings, made with Margaret's charcoal\
  \ on brown A&P bags, capture subway grates and row house stoops instead of trees\
  \ and fortresses.\n\nWhen his parents arrive on December 18th to take him back to\
  \ their reconciled life, he hides under Margaret's kitchen table, small fingers\
  \ gripping the table leg, the linoleum cold against his knees. The smell of her\
  \ apron—yeast and bacon grease and something indefinably Polish—becomes the scent\
  \ of security he'll chase unconsciously for the rest of his life.\n\nThis is the\
  \ timeline that got overwritten, the urban childhood that never was, preserved now\
  \ only in the quantum static between what happened and what could have been."
