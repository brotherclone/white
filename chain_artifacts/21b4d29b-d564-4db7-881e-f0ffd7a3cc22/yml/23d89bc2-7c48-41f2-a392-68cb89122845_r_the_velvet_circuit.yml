excerpts:
- 'The chrome gleamed like liquid mercury in the amber light of her boudoir, each
  curve and contour of the mechanical marvel reflecting her own silhouette in fractured
  perfection. Vivian Steele had commissioned the automaton from the finest craftsmen
  in Prague—men who understood that beauty and function need not be strangers. She
  traced one gloved finger along its polished shoulder, feeling the subtle vibration
  of the velvet-wrapped circuits humming beneath the surface.


  "You are more perfect than any man," she whispered to the silent figure, its sapphire
  eyes dark and waiting. The year was 1952, and the world was changing—but in her
  private sanctuary, time moved to the rhythm of her desires alone. The government
  men who had been asking questions about her "collection" could never understand.
  They saw only machinery where she saw poetry in motion.'
- 'Marcus Thornfield adjusted his tie nervously as he approached the imposing brass
  doors of the Steele mansion. The letter in his breast pocket bore the seal of the
  Department of Technological Oversight—a new bureau formed in the wake of certain
  "incidents" involving advanced mechanical devices. His mission was simple: investigate
  reports of illegal automatons and confiscate any that violated the Mechanical Persons
  Act of 1951.


  But as the doors opened to reveal a vision in emerald silk, her copper hair cascading
  like liquid fire, Marcus felt his resolve waver. Vivian Steele was more beautiful
  than the classified photographs had suggested, and there was something in her green
  eyes that spoke of secrets deeper than government files could contain. "Mr. Thornfield,"
  she purred, "I''ve been expecting you."'
