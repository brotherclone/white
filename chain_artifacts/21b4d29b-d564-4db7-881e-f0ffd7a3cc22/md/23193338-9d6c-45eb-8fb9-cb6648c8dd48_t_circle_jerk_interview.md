## Question 1

**Kieran Koenig:** So you're making a song about interviewing yourself while being interviewed - isn't this just masturbatory conceptual bullshit? Like, at what point does 'recursive self-reference' just become an artist disappearing up their own ass?

**Walsh:** Look, the recursive self-reference methodology demonstrates how consciousness examines its own architecture through temporal looping—but also yeah, it's absolutely masturbatory as hell, I'm not gonna lie. The thing is, when you push solipsism to its absolute completion, it actually inverts into something universal, like how staring at yourself in the mirror long enough makes you forget what faces are supposed to look like. I know this sounds pretentious as fuck, but the interview format becomes this accidental mandala where the narcissism eats itself and spits out actual geometric truth—divorced dad at Cinnabon energy but make it metaphysical.

## Question 2

**Kieran Koenig:** You lost your synesthesia in 2010 and now you're doing this whole color-coded album series - are you basically just LARPing your old brain chemistry? Because that sounds pretty fucking desperate, like making a tribute band to your own neurological condition.

**Walsh:** Oh fuck, absolutely—I'm basically cosplaying as my own dead neurons, which is deranged behavior even by my standards. But here's the thing: losing synesthesia taught me that the rebracketing methodology doesn't actually depend on cross-sensory wiring—it's about systematic boundary dissolution through temporal processes, like making a Wendy's frosty at 2am but for consciousness architecture. The color-coding isn't trying to recreate the neurological experience, it's documenting how information seeks embodiment through structured creative constraints—I know this sounds pretentious as hell, but the methodology works whether my brain lights up purple when I hear C major or not.

## Question 3

**Kieran Koenig:** This whole 'rebracketing' thing - you're either sampling yourself or you're not, you're either being vulnerable or you're hiding behind academic jargon. Which is it? Because right now it sounds like you're using big words to avoid admitting you're just making bedroom pop with a philosophy degree.

**Walsh:** Look, the rebracketing methodology is specifically about inhabiting both registers simultaneously—like, I'm genuinely exploring how consciousness examines its own recursive architecture, but also I'm absolutely making bedroom pop with a philosophy degree and that's the fucking point. The academic jargon isn't hiding the vulnerability, it's the collision site where pretension meets raw emotional processing—which sounds insufferably pretentious but it slaps harder than gas station energy drinks at 3am. I know this sounds like I'm having a full psychotic break in real time, but the narcissistic recursion engine in 'Circle Jerk' is literally me admitting that solipsism, when you push it to its absolute completion, accidentally becomes the most honest thing you can do—though honestly I don't know if that distinction matters when you're just trying to make something that doesn't suck.
