# Monarch butterfly (Eastern migratory population) / Rosa Elena Vásquez-Chen

## Species Arc: Monarch butterfly (Eastern migratory population)
Scientific documentation of population collapse from 1 billion overwintering monarchs (1996) to functional extinction (2045). Migration pattern disruption, habitat fragmentation across 3000-mile corridor, cascade effects through milkweed ecosystems and dependent species networks.

## Human Arc: Rosa Elena Vásquez-Chen
Intimate portrait of cultural extinction paralleling biological extinction: traditional knowledge keeper whose family's 200-year guiding tradition ends with her, children displaced to cities, ancient butterfly blessings spoken to empty forest.

## Parallel Moments

### 1. Forty-nine years before extinction
**Species:** 1996: Peak overwintering population of 1 billion monarchs creates orange canopy across 45 acres of Mexican mountain forest

**Human:** 1996: Seven-year-old Rosa learns to identify male and female monarchs by wing patterns, her grandmother's hands guiding hers to trace the differences

*Connection: Abundance and knowledge transmission at their peak*

### 2. Twenty years before extinction
**Species:** 2025: Population crashes to 2000 individuals, migration timing shifts three weeks later due to climate disruption

**Human:** 2025: Rosa's children leave for Mexico City, promise to visit during butterfly season but never return

*Connection: Broken patterns, failed returns, generational disconnection*

### 3. Two years before extinction
**Species:** 2043: Only twelve monarchs arrive at Cerro Pelón, clustering on trees marked for illegal logging

**Human:** 2043: Rosa stops updating visitor logs, speaks to butterflies in Purépecha words no one else remembers

*Connection: Final witnesses to their own extinction, carrying knowledge that dies with them*

### 4. Extinction year
**Species:** 2045: Last monarch dies in spring, migration pattern permanently broken

**Human:** 2045: Rosa touches her grandmother's pendant in empty forest, the last person who knows the blessing for dying butterflies

*Connection: End of ancient cycles, knowledge and species extinct together*

## Elegiac Quality
Achieves memorial through the preservation of specific knowledge - Rosa's grandmother's carved pendant, the Purépecha blessing words, the precise way monarchs cluster on oyamel branches. Loss becomes sacred through the dignity of witness, not through sentimentality. The parallel extinctions honor both species and culture without false consolation.
