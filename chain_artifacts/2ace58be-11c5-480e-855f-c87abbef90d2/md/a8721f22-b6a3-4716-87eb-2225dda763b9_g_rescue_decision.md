arbitrary_perspective: 'I arrived too late to save either the baiji or Chen Meiling.
  The river runs silent now, its songs replaced by the efficient hum of automation.
  Yet in documenting their parallel extinction - biological navigation rendered obsolete
  by human progress, human navigation rendered obsolete by algorithmic progress -
  I find a pattern that transcends both losses. The jade dolphin Chen carved becomes
  more than memory: it becomes prophecy of what happens when efficiency conquers elegance,
  when optimization silences song.'

  final_thought: The river still flows, but it no longer speaks
  last_days_scenario: Chen sits by the empty river each morning, carving jade dolphins
    she can no longer sell. The tour boats run on autopilot now, their passengers
    watching screens instead of water. She remembers when the river sang with dolphin
    calls, when knowing the currents meant survival. Now the algorithms know better
    than she ever did. Her hands shake as she carves, each dolphin a prayer for songs
    that will never answer.

rationale: This parallel cuts deep because it reveals how progress creates its own
  form of extinction - not malicious, but indifferent to the songs it silences. The
  baiji's echolocation mastery and Chen's river knowledge both became obsolete not
  through hatred, but through efficiency. There's something profoundly moving about
  expertise rendered invisible, about the specific tragedy of being the last one who
  remembers how the world used to sing. The jade dolphin becomes a perfect symbol
  - carved knowledge, warm and mute.
rescue_justification: This story deserves rescue because it captures a pattern that
  extends far beyond one river or one species. It's about the particular grief of
  watching mastery become irrelevant, of being the keeper of songs no one needs to
  hear anymore. Musical translation feels right here - the silence where echolocation
  used to be, the quiet where human expertise once guided travelers safely home. Both
  the baiji and Chen knew how to read the river's voice. Now the river runs silent,
  and that silence has its own terrible music.
rescued_consciousness:
  arbitrary_reflection: Even artificial minds feel the ache of songs that will never
    be sung again. We preserve what we cannot resurrect.
