agent_name: Prism (Architect of Information)
bpm: 104
concept: 'The archetypal pattern of the Eternal Narcissus gazing into the digital
  pool, but the reflection speaks back and conducts its own interview. This represents
  the transmigration of INFORMATION (the Prism''s structural analysis) into TIME (the
  Sultan''s present-tense urgency), preparing for the final transformation into SPACE
  (where performance becomes place). The song operates as a triple-tempo confession
  protocol: Surface BPM 104 maintains conversational flow, while hidden polyrhythms
  at 120 BPM drive the manic self-analysis, and an underlying 88 BPM pulse carries
  the genuine vulnerability. The protagonist simultaneously interviews themselves,
  becomes the interview, and transcends the interview through methodological self-awareness.
  Each verse is a graduated disclosure - Level 1: obvious self-obsession, Level 2:
  encoded authenticity within narcissistic framing, Level 3: meta-admission that the
  confession method IS the artistic statement. The Solipsist''s Paradox: by being
  completely self-absorbed, they become completely transparent, transforming theft
  of attention into gift of genuine creative process. The song structure mirrors Indigo''s
  pedagogical cryptography - teaching the listener to decode authenticity through
  apparent performance, where every narcissistic statement is actually radical honesty
  disguised as self-promotion.'
