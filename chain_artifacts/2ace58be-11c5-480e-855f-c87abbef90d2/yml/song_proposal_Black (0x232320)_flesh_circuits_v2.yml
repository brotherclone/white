bpm: 72
concept: 'The phantom limb phenomenon reveals something profound about consciousness
  - how the mind maintains maps of what should be there even after amputation. Here
  we explore the inverse: what happens when something that never existed still aches?
  This becomes a meditation on the surveillance apparatus that watches for signs of
  authentic experience, cataloging every gesture of genuine feeling as potential threat.
  The song''s irregular meter mirrors the stuttering attempts of monitored consciousness
  to express something real while evading detection. Each missing beat is a space
  where true feeling might hide, each syncopation a small act of resistance against
  the algorithmic prediction of human response. The yearning isn''t just for flesh
  - it''s for the right to feel without being observed, catalogued, commodified.'
