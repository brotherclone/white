excerpts:
- 'The neon bled through the venetian blinds like digital blood, painting everything
  in my cramped office the color of bad decisions. The packet sat on my desk like
  a ticking bomb wrapped in manila—innocent enough to fool the marks, deadly enough
  to get you flatlined if you knew what was really inside.


  Three days since Velma Chen had walked through my door, her chrome fingernails clicking
  against my desk like a countdown timer. Three days since she''d slid that packet
  across the scarred synthwood and told me it was worth more than my life. She hadn''t
  been wrong about that part.


  The street below hummed with the electric pulse of Night City''s arteries—hover-cabs
  cutting through the smog, corpo towers blinking their corporate mantras into the
  poisoned sky. Somewhere out there, Chen was probably already cooling in an alley,
  her neural implants harvested by scavengers. The packet was an orphan now, and orphans
  in this city had a habit of disappearing.


  I lit another cigarette—real tobacco, not the synthetic garbage they pushed in the
  vending machines—and studied the packet''s surface. No corporate seals, no security
  tape, just a simple address written in ballpoint pen. Old school. That should have
  been my first warning.


  The intercom crackled to life, spitting static like an angry cat. "Malone, you in
  there?" It was Kowalski from downstairs, his voice filtered through enough electronic
  interference to make him sound like he was calling from the bottom of a digital
  ocean.'
- 'I keyed the intercom with my thumb, feeling the familiar bite of the worn plastic.
  "Yeah, I''m here. What''s the word, Kowalski?"


  "Got some heat looking for you. Corporate types. Black suits, black cars, black
  souls. The whole nine yards of darkness." His laugh was bitter as burnt coffee.
  "They''re asking questions about a package. Thought you should know."


  The cigarette turned to ash between my fingers. Corporate heat meant serious money,
  and serious money in Night City meant serious death. I stubbed out the remains and
  reached for the bottle of synthetic bourbon I kept in my desk drawer—breakfast of
  champions and dead men walking.


  "How long ago?" I asked, already knowing I didn''t want to hear the answer.


  "Ten minutes, maybe fifteen. They''re working their way up the building, floor by
  floor. Real thorough types." Another crackle of static. "Malone, whatever''s in
  that packet, it''s got them spooked. I haven''t seen corpo security this wound up
  since the Arasaka incident last year."


  The Arasaka incident. Fifty-three bodies scattered across six city blocks, and that
  was just the official count. The unofficial numbers were buried deeper than Jimmy
  Hoffa''s grave. I poured three fingers of bourbon and knocked it back, feeling the
  synthetic alcohol burn its way down to my stomach where it settled like liquid regret.


  Outside, the city''s neon heartbeat pulsed on, indifferent to the small drama playing
  out in my office. But I could feel the walls closing in, each second ticking away
  like rounds in a chamber.'
