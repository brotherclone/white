text: 'FRANKLIN BOROUGH - Police and school officials are investigating an unusual
  incident at Franklin High School Friday evening that left seventeen students hospitalized
  and a local rock band''s equipment mysteriously damaged.


  The disturbance occurred during an after-school concert by "Phantom Limb," a four-piece
  experimental rock group composed of Franklin High seniors. According to witnesses,
  the band was performing an original composition in an unusual 7/8 time signature
  when students in the audience began experiencing what school nurse Patricia Kellerman
  described as "synchronized anxiety attacks."


  "It started about three minutes into their second song," said junior Mark Tessler,
  who was treated and released from Newton Memorial Hospital. "Everyone just started
  feeling like something was missing, like we were waiting for a beat that never came.
  Then kids started hyperventilating."


  Franklin High principal Robert Chen said the incident began when students reported
  feeling disoriented by the band''s unconventional rhythm. "Several students complained
  of phantom sensations, as if they could hear a beat that wasn''t there," Chen explained.
  "Within minutes, we had kids collapsing."


  The band''s lead guitarist, 17-year-old David Kessler, told police that their amplifiers
  began malfunctioning during the performance, producing what he described as "impossible
  frequencies" that seemed to create gaps in the music itself. When maintenance staff
  examined the equipment afterward, they found that all electronic components had
  been damaged in a pattern that audio technician James Wright called "architecturally
  impossible."


  "The circuitry was burned out in perfect geometric shapes," Wright said. "I''ve
  never seen anything like it. It''s as if the electricity was following some kind
  of blueprint."


  Dr. Margaret Hollis, who treated twelve of the affected students at Newton Memorial,
  said the victims exhibited symptoms consistent with acute anxiety disorder, but
  noted unusual similarities in their accounts. "They all described the same sensation
  of missing time, of waiting for something that never arrived," Hollis said. "Several
  mentioned feeling like they were hiding inside music that wasn''t playing."


  Sussex County Sheriff''s Department spokesman Lt. Michael Torres confirmed that
  investigators found no evidence of drug use among the students, despite initial
  suspicions about psychedelic substances. Blood tests on all seventeen hospitalized
  students came back negative for controlled substances.


  The band''s drummer, Jennifer Walsh, 18, said the group had been experimenting with
  "temporal safe house" compositions designed to create "cognitive hiding spaces"
  through incomplete musical structures. "We were trying to build something where
  your mind could disappear into the gaps," Walsh explained. "We never expected it
  to work this well."


  School officials have suspended all after-school musical performances pending a
  full investigation. The band''s equipment remains in police custody.


  Phantom Limb formed six months ago and had performed only twice before Friday''s
  incident. Following the disturbance, the four members announced they were disbanding
  immediately. Attempts to reach the band members over the weekend were unsuccessful,
  with neighbors reporting that all four families appeared to have left town.


  The investigation continues. Anyone with information about Friday''s incident is
  asked to contact the Sussex County Sheriff''s Department.'
