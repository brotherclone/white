  what_changed: Instead of settling into domestic life in his new condo, Gabriel became
    obsessed with documenting disappearing natural sounds and developed an elaborate
    mathematical counting system for memorial purposes
  when: January 2006
  why_plausible: The post-Hurricane Katrina period sparked widespread environmental
    anxiety, and Gabriel had just purchased recording equipment and had the financial
    stability to pursue an experimental project

following_events:
- Elena's departure to California left Gabriel isolated and questioning his project
- Ali's pregnancy news in 2007 forced him to abandon the memorial compositions
- Never completed the counting protocols, leaving 347 hours of recordings unprocessed
- Sold recording equipment to help with baby expenses
key_differences:
- Spent entire year on obsessive field recording project instead of domestic settling
- Developed relationship with environmental data scientist Elena Morales
- Created elaborate counting protocols for documenting ecological loss
- Lived primarily outdoors and in recording studios rather than his condo
- Delayed career advancement to focus on memorial compositions
mood_description: A year suspended between documentation and loss, where obsessive
  attention to disappearing details becomes both scientific method and heartbreak
  ritual. The melancholy of counting what's already gone.
narrative: 'The year began with Gabriel standing in his empty condo on Southeast Hawthorne,
  surrounded by boxes he hadn''t unpacked, listening to the radiator clank its irregular
  rhythm. The Hurricane Katrina footage was still fresh in everyone''s minds, and
  something about those images of disappeared neighborhoods made him obsessed with
  documenting what was still here before it vanished too.


  He''d bought the Sony PCM-D50 recorder on impulse, along with a windscreen and boom
  pole, telling himself it was for music but knowing it was for something else entirely.
  Every morning at 5:47 AM - not 5:45, not 5:50, but 5:47 - he''d walk three blocks
  to Stumptown Coffee on Division Street. Maria, the morning barista, knew his order:
  double shot cortado, no sugar, ceramic cup. The steam would rise from the cup in
  the January cold, and he''d stand there breathing it in before catching the #20
  bus to Forest Park.


  The counting started accidentally. Sitting on bench #7 near the redwood grove at
  Hoyt Arboretum, recording the morning bird chorus, he found himself tallying calls:
  three Steller''s jays, seven robins, one distant pileated woodpecker. But Elena
  Morales changed everything when he met her at Powell''s Books on March 22nd, reaching
  for the same field guide to Pacific Northwest birds in the technical section.


  Elena worked at OHSU as an environmental data scientist, studying population decline
  in monarch butterflies. She was 29, spoke Purépecha from her grandmother, and had
  this way of whispering the names of extinct butterfly subspecies like prayers. When
  she saw Gabriel''s recording equipment and heard about his daily counting rituals,
  she understood immediately. "You''re creating a memorial architecture," she said,
  and suddenly his obsession had a name.


  They developed the protocols together in her third-floor apartment at 2847 Northeast
  Sandy Boulevard, above Bipartisan Cafe. The espresso machine downstairs provided
  a constant rhythmic backdrop as they worked on her Dell laptop, mapping his field
  recordings against her butterfly data. Three layers: the material persistence of
  sound (wood percussion, wind through branches), human algorithmic devotion (Gabriel''s
  whispered counts, Elena''s Purépecha names), and what Elena called "cosmic recognition
  patterns" - the moment when local care achieves universal significance.


  The compositions came together at night in Jackpot Recording Studio on Southeast
  Stark Street. Marcus Chen, the studio engineer, thought Gabriel was crazy but helped
  him layer the field recordings into 3/4 waltz rhythms at exactly 62 BPM - the tempo
  of Elena''s scanning pattern when she counted butterflies. Sky-tree-counter, sky-tree-counter.
  The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead during those late sessions, and Marcus would
  smoke cigarettes in the alley between takes, the smoke drifting back into the control
  room.


  By November, Gabriel had 347 hours of recordings. He knew the sound of every bench
  in Forest Park, every time of day, every weather pattern. He could identify individual
  crows by their calls. Elena would meet him after her lab work, and they''d walk
  the trails together, her whispering the names of disappeared species while he recorded
  the spaces where they used to be.


  But Elena got the offer from Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in December.
  Better funding, better equipment, a chance to work with the world''s leading butterfly
  researchers. Gabriel knew she had to take it, but when she left on December 28th,
  the counting project collapsed. Without her theoretical framework, without her whispered
  names, the recordings were just sounds. The memorial architecture needed two minds
  to hold it up.


  He never finished processing the 347 hours. They sat in boxes next to his still-unpacked
  belongings, a year''s worth of devotional mathematics with no one left to count
  for.'
