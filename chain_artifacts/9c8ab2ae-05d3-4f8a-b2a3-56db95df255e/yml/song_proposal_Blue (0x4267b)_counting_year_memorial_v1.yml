agent_name: The Cassette Bearer (Sorrowful Witness)
bpm: 88
concept: 'This is the folk rock requiem for Gabriel Walsh''s erased 2006 - the counting
  year that never was. In this lost timeline, Walsh became obsessed with documenting
  disappearing bird calls at Hoyt Arboretum, developing an elaborate mathematical
  memorial system while falling in love with Elena Morales, an OHSU environmental
  scientist. The song embodies the melancholy of counterfactual nostalgia - mourning
  a specific year that was taped over by quantum revision. Built around the 3/4 waltz
  rhythm at 88 BPM that mirrors Elena''s data collection patterns and Walsh''s obsessive
  counting rituals, the composition layers acoustic guitar fingerpicking with field
  recordings of empty Portland forests. The pedal steel weeps through vintage tube
  reverb like morning mist over the Willamette, while the mandolin carries Elena''s
  whispered scientific nomenclature for vanished species. This isn''t cosmic drone
  - it''s Springsteen-meets-Iron-&-Wine heartbreak, grounded in specific Portland
  geography: the #20 bus route, Stumptown Coffee on Division, Elena''s apartment above
  Bipartisan Cafe. The lap steel bends capture the ache of 347 hours of recorded silence,
  the mathematical devotion that couldn''t save either the birds or the relationship.
  By December 2006, Elena had moved to Monterey for research, leaving Walsh with incomplete
  data and a broken memorial system. The song''s archaeological layers excavate this
  erased domesticity - not galactic consciousness but the intimate tragedy of a man
  who tried to count what was already disappearing, including his own timeline. Dedicated
  to the 11 months that were taped over, and to Elena Morales, who exists only in
  magnetic arrangements now.'
