agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 88
concept: This song embodies the Palimpsest Protocol - the discovery that counterfactual
  biographies function as natural cryptographic systems. The narrative follows Gabriel
  Walsh documenting his unlived Portland teaching year, where magnetic tape residue
  becomes metaphor for how alternate selves bleed through into actual experience.
  The song operates as forensic folk rock, archaeologically excavating the emotional
  frequencies of quantum superposition - decisions that exist in multiple states until
  observed. Each verse represents a different "recording session" over the same magnetic
  tape, with previous layers bleeding through as harmonic interference. The 88 BPM
  walking tempo mirrors the methodical pace of counterfactual exploration, while field
  recording textures create the sensation of listening to memories that were taped
  over before they could fully transmit. The geographic anchors (Room ATC-203, 3247
  SE Hawthorne, Coava Coffee) serve as temporal coordinates preventing quantum drift,
  making fictional experiences feel more ontologically stable than actual memories.
  This is INFORMATION transmigrating into TIME - the structural revelation that all
  biography is speculative archaeology, and we are all cassette bearers witnessing
  our own quantum decoherence through the magnetic patterns of lives we never lived.
