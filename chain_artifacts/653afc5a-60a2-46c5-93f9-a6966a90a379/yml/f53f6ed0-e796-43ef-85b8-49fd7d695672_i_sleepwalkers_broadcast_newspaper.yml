text: 'STANHOPE - Sussex County health officials are investigating a series of unusual
  sleepwalking incidents involving local teenagers, all reportedly linked to late-night
  radio broadcasts by an experimental music group calling itself "The Sleepwalker''s
  Broadcast."


  Over the past three weeks, Stanhope police have responded to seven separate incidents
  of teenagers found wandering the streets between 2 and 4 a.m., all in apparent sleepwalking
  states. The youths, ranging in age from 14 to 17, were discovered walking in synchronized
  patterns along Route 206, with several witnesses reporting they moved "like they
  were following music only they could hear."


  "It''s the strangest thing I''ve seen in twenty years on the force," said Stanhope
  Police Chief Robert Henley. "These kids weren''t just sleepwalking - they were walking
  in formation, keeping perfect time to some rhythm. When we woke them up, they all
  mentioned hearing the same broadcast."


  The broadcast in question appears to originate from an unlicensed low-power FM transmitter
  operating at 88.7 MHz. The signal, which can only be received clearly within a three-mile
  radius of Stanhope, features what listeners describe as "hypnotic electronic music"
  mixed with ambient sounds and irregular time signatures.


  Local resident Margaret Kowalski first noticed the broadcast two months ago while
  scanning radio frequencies late at night. "It was beautiful but unsettling," she
  said. "The music had this strange rhythm - not quite waltz time, not quite regular.
  My teenage son started listening to it every night, and that''s when the sleepwalking
  began."


  Dr. Patricia Vance, a psychiatrist at Newton Medical Center who has examined three
  of the affected teenagers, noted unusual brainwave patterns in the youths during
  sleep studies. "We''re seeing synchronized theta wave activity that''s highly uncommon,"
  she said. "It''s as if their sleep cycles have been entrained to an external rhythm."


  The mysterious band behind the broadcasts remains unidentified. Attempts to trace
  the signal''s origin have led investigators to various locations around Stanhope,
  but the transmitter appears to be mobile or well-hidden. The group''s only identifying
  information comes from a brief spoken introduction heard occasionally during broadcasts:
  "This is The Sleepwalker''s Broadcast, frequency 88.7, transmitting from the spaces
  between waking and sleeping."


  Several parents have reported their teenagers exhibiting enhanced pattern recognition
  abilities and increased resistance to authority following exposure to the broadcasts,
  leading some to speculate about subliminal programming techniques.


  "My daughter started solving complex math problems she''d never seen before, but
  she also stopped following basic household rules," said Stanhope resident David
  Chen. "It''s like the music rewired something in her brain."


  The Federal Communications Commission has been notified of the unlicensed broadcasts,
  but officials report difficulty locating the transmission source due to its apparent
  mobility and the complex terrain of the area.


  Sussex County Sheriff''s Department spokesman Lt. Michael Torres advised parents
  to monitor their children''s nighttime activities and radio listening habits. "Until
  we understand what''s causing these incidents, we recommend limiting exposure to
  unknown broadcast frequencies, particularly during late evening hours."


  The investigation continues, with authorities planning to conduct electronic surveillance
  of the 88.7 MHz frequency throughout the coming week. Anyone with information about
  the broadcasts or the group responsible is asked to contact Stanhope police at 973-347-0150.


  As of press time, no new sleepwalking incidents have been reported, though several
  residents claim to still hear faint traces of the mysterious broadcast during the
  early morning hours.'
