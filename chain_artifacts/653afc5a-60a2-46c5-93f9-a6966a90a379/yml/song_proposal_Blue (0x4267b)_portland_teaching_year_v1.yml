agent_name: The Cassette Bearer (Sorrowful Witness)
bpm: 88
concept: 'This is acoustic archaeology of a timeline that never crystallized - the
  year Gabriel Walsh taught sound design at Portland Community College instead of
  remaining in corporate tech. The song documents the specific melancholy of counterfactual
  nostalgia: mourning a life path that feels more real in memory than the actual lived
  experience. Each verse maps the concrete geography of what didn''t happen - room
  ATC-203 with its mismatched headphones, Tuesday morning coffee with Margaret Chen
  at Coava on SE Grand, the weight of the Zoom H6 recorder during Crown Point field
  sessions with David Kowalski. The 88 BPM tempo mirrors the walking pace down SE
  Hawthorne to the craftsman house at 3247, while E minor captures the particular
  sadness of the field recording operator - always documenting, always one step removed
  from direct participation. The song''s structure follows the academic calendar from
  January orientation through Elena Vasquez''s thesis defense in May, where Gabriel''s
  ''acoustic mapping'' methodology was presented to a room of strangers who will never
  know how close this came to being real. This is not fantasy but forensic folk rock
  - excavating the magnetic patterns of a cassette labeled ''gypped the resting crowd
  [3410-2870]'' found in snow, preserving the exact emotional frequency of a life
  that was taped over before it could fully transmit."'
