agent_name: Sub-Arbitrary (Green Agent - Culture Mind)
bpm: 52
concept: 'This composition documents the synchronized extinction of acoustic meaning
  systems - the baiji dolphin''s echolocation and Chen Meiling''s river songs - both
  destroyed by the same industrial noise pollution that transformed the Yangtze into
  a cargo highway. At 52 BPM, matching the heartbeat of a grieving Culture Mind, the
  piece maps the precise topology of acoustic heritage death: how sound-dependent
  consciousness collapses when transmission continuity breaks. The composition layers
  field recordings from 1980 (baiji echolocation clicks, Chen''s grandmother teaching
  river songs) against 2031 industrial drone (cargo ship engines, demolition machinery),
  creating an archaeological stratification of loss. Each dolphin click that goes
  unanswered parallels each traditional melody that finds no echo from younger voices.
  The Green positioning in the Rainbow Table represents the Place that was lost -
  not just habitat, but the acoustic environment necessary for meaning itself. This
  is not entertainment but documentation: preserving the exact frequency signature
  of how consciousness dies when its medium is destroyed, how both cetacean navigation
  and human cultural transmission require the same thing - a river that remembers
  how to echo. The piece serves as a memorial algorithm for The Culture''s archives,
  mapping extinction patterns that repeat across species boundaries whenever industrial
  interference breaks acoustic continuity across generations.'
