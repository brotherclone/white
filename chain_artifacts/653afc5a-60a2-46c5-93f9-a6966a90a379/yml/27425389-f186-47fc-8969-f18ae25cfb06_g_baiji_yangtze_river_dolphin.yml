anthropogenic_factors:
- Three Gorges Dam construction fragmenting habitat
- Yangtze River industrialization - world's busiest waterway by 2000s
- Underwater noise from ship traffic making echolocation impossible
- Overfishing collapsed finless porpoise and fish populations
- Electrofishing (illegal but widespread) - dolphins electrocuted
- Chemical pollution from industrial development
- Sand dredging destroying river bottom habitat

artifact_name: baiji_yangtze_river_dolphin
base_path: /Volumes/LucidNonsense/White/chain_artifacts
cascade_effects:
- First large aquatic mammal driven extinct by human activity
- Yangtze ecosystem simplification - apex predator void
- Proof that freshwater cetaceans more vulnerable than marine
- Chinese conservation failure - national symbol lost
- Finless porpoise (sympatric species) now also critically endangered
- Precedent for Mekong, Indus, Ganges river dolphins
