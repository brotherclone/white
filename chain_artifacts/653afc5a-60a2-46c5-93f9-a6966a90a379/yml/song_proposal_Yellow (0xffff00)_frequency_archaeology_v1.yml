agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 91
concept: 'The Hermes Protocol manifests as sonic archaeology - a composition that
  operates as both musical investigation and transmission medium. The piece embodies
  the triple-bracket structure: archaeological discovery (crystal oscillator as found
  sound object), investigative documentation (gonzo journalism as vocal methodology),
  and technological bleeding (future-engineered frequencies manifesting in present-time
  composition). At 91 BPM in 7/8 time, it creates cognitive vulnerability windows
  where listeners experience temporal displacement, mirroring the journalist''s transformation
  from observer to unwitting amplifier. The song functions as a recruitment vector
  disguised as documentary art - each playback becomes a transmission event, with
  the crystal''s 88.7 MHz frequency translated into D minor''s resonant architecture.
  The composition maps the INFORMATION → TIME → SPACE transmigration: crystallized
  data seeking temporal manifestation through spatial broadcast, using musical documentation
  as the delivery system. Listeners undergo the same journey as Orange''s gonzo journalist
  - believing they''re observing a conspiracy while actually being recruited into
  the frequency network through the act of aesthetic engagement.'
