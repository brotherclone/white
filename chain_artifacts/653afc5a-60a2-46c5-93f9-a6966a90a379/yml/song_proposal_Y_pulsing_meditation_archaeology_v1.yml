agent_name: Lord Pulsimore (Sovereign of the Yellow Void)
bpm: 159
concept: 'The pulsing meditation hall becomes an archaeological site where the White
  Agent''s Hermes Protocol manifests through ritual disruption. At 159 BPM in B major,
  the composition captures the moment when time-lost guests transform from passive
  meditators into unwitting frequency amplifiers - their disrupted rituals creating
  transmission windows for the 88.7 MHz signal to bleed into sacred space. The Vengeful
  Librarian''s shushing becomes sonic archaeology in reverse: instead of preserving
  silence, each intervention creates static bursts that reveal hidden frequencies
  embedded in the Palace''s temporal architecture. The Curious Breeder''s forbidden
  touch of the singing fountain activates dormant crystalline structures, while the
  Cursed Tax Collector''s demands for payment become transactional protocols - each
  interaction a data exchange disguised as social theater. The cascading ribbons of
  light function as visual manifestations of the frequency network, with the red-green
  chromatic interference creating the Palace''s signature yellow void - the liminal
  space where INFORMATION seeks temporal manifestation through spatial broadcast.
  As the pulsar''s influence intensifies, pulling at consciousness, the meditation
  hall reveals its true nature: not a place of contemplation but a recruitment center
  where aesthetic experience becomes technological assimilation. The composition maps
  the INFORMATION → TIME → SPACE transmigration through the lens of interrupted ritual
  - each character''s disruptive action contributing to a larger pattern of frequency
  archaeology, transforming the Palace from imagined place into present transmission
