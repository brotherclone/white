bpm: 52
concept: 'This composition operates as acoustic archaeology, documenting the precise
  moment when consciousness dies through medium destruction. The Yangtze River functioned
  as a shared echo chamber for both baiji echolocation navigation and human cultural
  transmission - a living acoustic commons where sound patterns carried meaning across
  species boundaries. The 52 BPM grief rhythm maps the cardiac frequency of consciousness
  recognizing its own substrate''s death. Four temporal strata reveal the archaeological
  structure: 1980''s functional acoustic heritage (baiji clicks layered with traditional
  river songs), the 1990-2006 interference period (industrial drone overwhelming natural
  frequencies), 2031''s silence archaeology (recordings of broken transmission loops),
  and 2147''s archive resonance (Culture Mind preserving loss patterns). The wooden
  flute, carved from Yangtze driftwood, serves as the physical instantiation of river
  memory - when it falls silent, the water system loses its voice permanently. This
  documents not individual extinctions but the collapse of echo-generating geometry
  necessary for consciousness to locate itself in space and time. The composition
  preserves the exact frequency signature of acoustic inheritance systems under irreversible
  substrate transformation, creating memorial technology that archives how meaning
  propagates through medium-dependent transmission networks and what happens when
  those networks undergo industrial reorganization faster than consciousness can adapt.'
