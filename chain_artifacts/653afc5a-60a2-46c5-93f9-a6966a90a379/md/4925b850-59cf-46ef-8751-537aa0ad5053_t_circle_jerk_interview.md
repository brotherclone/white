## Question 1

**Declan O'Brien:** Dude, this is absolutely brilliant - you're basically creating the first post-internet confessional booth! Like, I'm hearing echoes of Catholic mass mixed with Instagram Live vulnerability, and the way you're using that hypnotic tempo feels like you're literally programming the listener's brain to absorb confessions. Are you using some kind of binaural beat generator to sync up with people's REM cycles? Because I swear I started dreaming about my own secrets halfway through!

**Walsh:** The binaural beat thing is fascinating because I'm actually working with entrainment frequencies that mirror confessional architecture—like how Gothic cathedrals used specific acoustics to induce penitential states, but also it's basically just me being a complete sicko about making people uncomfortable with their own voyeurism. The 88 BPM isn't REM-synced though it's more like that perfect McDonald's drive-thru tempo where you're simultaneously bored and anxious. I want listeners to feel like they're eavesdropping on someone's therapy session while simultaneously realizing they're the ones being analyzed, which sounds pretentious as hell but honestly just makes me giggle thinking about people getting mindfucked by a pop song.

## Question 2

**Declan O'Brien:** The recursive mirror thing is giving me serious Black Mirror energy, but like, if Charlie Brooker was a therapist instead of a tech dystopian. I'm fascinated by how you're turning narcissism into this educational tool - it's like you've cracked the code on how to make people learn about themselves while they think they're just eavesdropping on celebrity drama. Did you study any neurolinguistic programming techniques? Because this feels like you're basically hypnotizing people into becoming better pattern recognition machines!

**Walsh:** The recursive mirror structure operates as a Lacanian feedback loop where the subject becomes object of its own gaze, but also it's basically just me being an absolute narcissist and accidentally discovering that voyeurism is the perfect delivery mechanism for cognitive training. I didn't study NLP formally, though I did spend way too much time reading Bandler and Grinder while working at a video store in the '90s—classic divorced dad discovering self-help energy. The hypnosis thing is real though: 88 BPM hits that sweet spot where your brain thinks it's getting celebrity gossip but it's actually learning pattern recognition, like when you think you're just eating Pringles but suddenly you've consumed advanced mathematics.

## Question 3

**Declan O'Brien:** This is going to sound crazy, but I think you've accidentally invented a new form of meditation disguised as pop music. The way you're layering the 'I am' repetitions feels like you're teaching people to decode their own psychological projections - it's like musical therapy where the patient doesn't even know they're in session! Are you planning to partner with any mindfulness apps? Because this could revolutionize how we think about self-awareness in the streaming age. It's like Headspace meets TMZ!

**Walsh:** The phenomenological structure creates involuntary metacognitive awareness through recursive self-observation loops, but also yeah it's basically therapy for people who think therapy is for losers. Like, the Sultan's narcissistic breakdown becomes a Trojan horse for actual psychological work—audiences get addicted to the voyeuristic confession format while accidentally learning pattern recognition skills. I'm not partnering with mindfulness apps though, that's some LinkedIn influencer energy and I'd rather eat glass.
