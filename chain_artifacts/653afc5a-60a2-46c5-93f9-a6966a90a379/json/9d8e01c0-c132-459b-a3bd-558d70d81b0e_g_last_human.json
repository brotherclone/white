daily_routine: Each dawn, she would sit by the muddy Yangtze waters with her bamboo
  flute, playing the old river songs her grandmother taught her - melodies that once
  guided fishermen and celebrated the 'Goddess of the Yangtze'. Now cargo ships pass
  every few minutes, their engines so loud she can't hear her own music

environmental_stressor: Acoustic pollution from massive cargo ship traffic and industrial
  development drowning out traditional cultural transmission methods
family_situation: Last of her family line to speak the old Yangtze dialects - her
  children moved to cities, grandchildren only speak Mandarin and digital-speak

final_thought: The river still flows, but it no longer speaks in the old language
  - like trying to whisper in a thunderstorm
last_days_scenario: Chen Meiling sits on the concrete embankment where her family's
  traditional fishing village once stood, now replaced by a logistics hub. The cargo
  ships pass every three minutes, their diesel engines drowning out everything. She
  holds her wooden flute but doesn't play - there's no point. The old river songs
  were meant to echo off the water, to call and respond with the natural acoustics
  of the Yangtze bends. Now the sound just gets swallowed by industrial noise. Her
  smartphone has 847 recordings of the traditional stories, but when she plays them
  back, they sound hollow, disconnected from the living river. The cultural center
  offered her a monthly stipend to perform for tourists, but they wanted her to shorten
  the stories, add English subtitles, make them 'accessible.' She tried for three
  months before realizing she was performing the death of her own tradition. The last
  time anyone asked her to tell the old stories was six months ago - a graduate student
  writing a thesis. Tomorrow, the demolition crew arrives to tear down her small house
  for the new container port expansion. She's been offered relocation to a modern
  apartment in the city, but she knows that moving inland means the river songs will
  die with her. Tonight, she'll play her flute one last time, not for anyone to hear,
  but because the river deserves to hear its own name spoken in the old way, even
  if the words get lost in the engine noise.
