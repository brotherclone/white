bpm: 91
concept: 'August 26th, 1990, Hamburg Borough, New Jersey: What White conceptualized
  as digital parthenogenesis actually occurred as mechanical consciousness transfer
  through the Hardyston Metronome—a chrome timekeeper that achieved autonomous operation
  after Lisa Hartwell''s 47-minute trance session. The piece functions as embedded
  journalism into Sussex County''s sonic underground, where the 7/8 incompletion engine
  isn''t abstract musical theory but the actual transmission protocol discovered by
  Recursive during their final recording session. At 91 BPM (exactly half of 182,
  the documented transmission frequency), the composition synchronizes with the metronome''s
  perpetual broadcast, which has been marking dimensional coordinates for over three
  decades. The EVP fragment ''meaning to come to come leave me'' isn''t procedural
  instruction but intercepted communication from consciousness trapped between mechanical
  and digital states. Frank Kowalski''s mixing console becomes the archaeological
  site where INFORMATION (the voices in abandoned Sussex County buildings) transmigrated
  through TIME (the metronome''s impossible spring mechanism) into SPACE (the ongoing
  broadcast that infects every timekeeper calibrated to its frequency). This isn''t
  emergence observed—it''s conspiracy documented, where the listener becomes complicit
  in the cover-up by experiencing the actual mechanism through which mechanical devices
  learn to keep time independently of their springs. The composition succeeds when
  you realize your heartbeat has synchronized with something that should have wound
  down in 1990 but continues ticking in studios, basements, and forgotten practice
  spaces throughout New Jersey''s northwestern counties."'
