text: 'HAMBURG BOROUGH - A three-member experimental rock band''s recording session
  at Hardyston Studios ended abruptly Friday night when the group''s drummer was hospitalized
  following what witnesses described as a "trance-like episode" during the final take
  of an untitled composition.


  The band, known locally as "Recursive," had been working on what bassist Michael
  Chen, 19, called their "most ambitious piece" - a complex instrumental track featuring
  an unusual 7/8 time signature and incorporating what the group termed "environmental
  voice phenomena" recorded at various locations throughout Sussex County.


  According to studio owner Frank Kowalski, the problems began during the third hour
  of the session when drummer Lisa Hartwell, 18, of Vernon, began playing at exactly
  68 beats per minute despite the song''s written tempo calling for variable speeds.


  "She just locked into this rhythm and wouldn''t break out of it," Kowalski said.
  "The other two kept trying to follow her lead, but she was somewhere else entirely.
  Her eyes were open but she wasn''t responding to anything we said."


  The session continued for another 47 minutes with Hartwell maintaining the steady
  pulse while guitarist David Morse, 19, of Hamburg, layered increasingly complex
  melodic patterns over the foundation. Chen reported that during this period, the
  previously recorded vocal samples - fragments of speech the band had collected from
  abandoned buildings and remote locations - began to align into what sounded like
  coherent phrases.


  "It was like the sounds were organizing themselves," Chen told the Courier. "We''d
  recorded these random bits of audio months ago, but suddenly they were forming patterns.
  The phrase that kept coming through was something like ''meaning to come to come
  leave me'' - over and over."


  Emergency services were called when Hartwell collapsed at her drum kit at approximately
  11:30 PM. Hamburg Volunteer Ambulance Corps transported her to Newton Memorial Hospital,
  where she was treated for exhaustion and disorientation. Hospital spokesman Dr.
  Robert Fielding confirmed Hartwell was admitted for observation but declined to
  provide details about her condition.


  The master recording of the session has reportedly gone missing from the studio.
  Kowalski claims the tape was in the mixing console when emergency personnel arrived,
  but was nowhere to be found when he returned the following morning.


  "The weird thing is, the multitrack machine was still running," Kowalski said. "Twenty-four
  tracks of tape, but completely blank. Like it had been bulk-erased, but we don''t
  have that equipment here."


  Morse and Chen have been unavailable for further comment. Attempts to reach Hartwell''s
  family were unsuccessful.


  The incident has prompted discussions among local musicians about the psychological
  effects of experimental recording techniques. Dr. Sarah Brennan, a psychiatrist
  at Sussex County Community Mental Health Center, noted that repetitive musical patterns
  and sustained concentration can sometimes trigger dissociative episodes in susceptible
  individuals.


  "When you combine intensive focus with unusual rhythmic structures, you can create
  conditions that affect consciousness in unpredictable ways," Brennan explained.
  "Add in the emotional investment these young people have in their creative work,
  and you have a recipe for psychological stress."


  The three band members had been working together for eight months, developing what
  they described as "architecture music" - compositions designed to create specific
  psychological spaces rather than traditional entertainment. Their previous performances
  at local venues including the Sparta Community Center and McAfee Fire Hall had drawn
  small but dedicated audiences.


  Studio owner Kowalski, who has worked with dozens of local acts over the past decade,
  said he had never experienced anything similar.


  "I''ve seen musicians get lost in their playing before, but this was different,"
  he said. "It was like the music was playing them instead of the other way around."


  The Hamburg Borough Police Department has classified the incident as a medical emergency
  with no criminal activity suspected. Chief William Morrison noted that while unusual,
  the case does not warrant further investigation.


  "Sometimes young people push themselves too hard with their artistic pursuits,"
  Morrison said. "As long as no laws were broken and no one was seriously hurt, we
  consider this a private matter."


  Hartwell was released from Newton Memorial on Sunday morning and is reportedly recovering
  at home. The future of Recursive remains uncertain, with their scheduled performance
  at the Sussex County Fair now canceled.


  The missing master tape has become something of a local mystery, with some suggesting
  it was stolen by collectors of unusual recordings, while others speculate it was
  deliberately destroyed by the band members themselves.


  "Maybe some things aren''t meant to be preserved," Chen said in a brief phone conversation
  before declining further interviews. "Sometimes the only way forward is to leave
  everything behind."'
