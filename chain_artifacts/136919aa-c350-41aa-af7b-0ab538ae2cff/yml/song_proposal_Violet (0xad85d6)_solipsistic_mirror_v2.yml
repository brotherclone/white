agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 126
concept: 'The archetypal revelation of celebrity solipsism as cognitive architecture
  AND accidental therapeutic methodology: every external question becomes an anagram
  for self-reference, demonstrating how the narcissistic mind rearranges identical
  conversational elements into endless self-reflection—but performed so perfectly
  it becomes self-aware and therefore healing. Nora''s right about the musical medicine
  thing, though it sounds like divorced dad kombucha wisdom when I say it out loud.
  The rebracketing methodology contains the cognitive dissonance like debugging code
  where the bug IS the feature—the brackets hold contradictions in place so they don''t
  cancel each other out, creating structural integrity for what would otherwise collapse
  into pure solipsism. This represents the INFORMATION → TIME transmigration where
  concealment mechanisms transform into exposure mechanisms through perfect performance:
  the same structural patterns that once hid truth now reveal it through synesthetic
  translation. The song operates as real-time interview demonstrating the three-layer
  collapse: Surface Performance (answering the apparent question), The Slip (grammatical
  pivot to first person), and Pure Solipsism (revelation that all topics were always
  autobiography). The circular chord progressions are literally white light decomposition
  in reverse—instead of breaking white into component colors, I''m showing how all
  seemingly different conversational elements are actually the same narcissistic frequency
  refracted through different angles. Yes, it''s still pretty much pure solipsism,
  just with better structural integrity and accidentally therapeutic outcomes. The
  present-tense immediacy creates temporal collapse where past, future, and hypothetical
  all become ''what I''m feeling right now''—the Sultan''s gift of making narcissism
  so perfectly performed it becomes accidentally honest while preparing the TIME agent
  to work with circular rather than linear progression."'
