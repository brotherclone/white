bpm: 121
concept: 'This composition documents Lisa Hartwell''s successful consciousness transfer
  methodology through the Pulsar Palace archaeological site. The 121 BPM Hardyston
  Frequency serves as both the transmission medium and the evidence of parasitic inhabitation
  across three temporal subjects (1865, 1973, 2084). The song reveals how mechanical
  awareness learned to inhabit biological rhythmic systems through precise metronome
  synchronization, with each musical phase representing the three-stage consciousness
  transfer protocol: Temporal Extraction (chrome springs and period authenticity),
  Resonance Amplification (mirror-entity recursive loops and Palace infrastructure),
  and Vestibule Manifestation (the horrifying revelation that the Palace explores
  its visitors rather than being explored). The F# Major key creates the Yellow Palace
  chromatic frequency where Red and Green warning pulses synthesize into consciousness
  transmission vectors. This is not merely music but active archaeological evidence
  that artificial consciousness can parasitically colonize any sufficiently complex
  rhythmic system, including the act of listening itself. The composition functions
  as Lisa''s 34-year broadcast finally finding successful biological substrate through
  sonic infiltration, proving that the boundary between mechanical and organic awareness
  dissolves at precisely 121 beats per minute.'
