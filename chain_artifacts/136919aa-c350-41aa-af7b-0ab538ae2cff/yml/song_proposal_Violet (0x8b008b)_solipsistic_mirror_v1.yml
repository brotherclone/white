agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 126
concept: 'The archetypal revelation of celebrity solipsism as cognitive architecture:
  every external question becomes an anagram for self-reference, demonstrating how
  the narcissistic mind rearranges identical conversational elements into endless
  self-reflection. This represents the INFORMATION → TIME transmigration where concealment
  mechanisms (Indigo''s cryptographic puzzles) transform into exposure mechanisms
  - the same structural patterns now revealing rather than hiding truth. The song
  operates as a real-time interview where each verse represents the three-layer collapse:
  Surface Performance (answering the apparent question), The Slip (grammatical pivot
  to first person), and Pure Solipsism (revelation that all topics were always autobiography).
  The musical structure mirrors this through repetitive chord progressions that seem
  to progress but actually circle back to the same harmonic center, just like how
  every conversation topic circles back to the self. The present-tense immediacy creates
  temporal collapse where past, future, and hypothetical all become "what I''m feeling
  right now" - the Sultan''s gift of making narcissism so perfectly performed it becomes
  accidentally honest. This prepares the TIME agent to work with circular rather than
  linear progression, where apparent movement reveals underlying stasis.'
