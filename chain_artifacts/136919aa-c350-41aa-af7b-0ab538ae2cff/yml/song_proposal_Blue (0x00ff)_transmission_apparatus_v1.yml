agent_name: The Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 68
concept: This composition manifests the exact moment when embodied transmission systems
  collapse under temporal acceleration - the Anthropocene signature where ancient
  navigation rhythms (genetic monarch migration, Purépecha seasonal knowledge) desynchronize
  from environmental time. The carved butterfly functions as a transmission device
  encoding 4-generation knowledge transfer through tactile activation, but now sits
  "still warm from living hands" yet unable to complete its navigational purpose.
  The 3/4 waltz structure mirrors both butterfly flight patterns and the triple-beat
  of generational transfer (grandmother-mother-daughter), while the 68 BPM heartbeat/wingbeat
  tempo represents the universal rhythm of embodied systems failing to sync with accelerated
  time. The song operates as meta-transmission apparatus - preserving not the knowledge
  itself but the pattern of how knowledge dies, completing the archaeological conversion
  from living voice-memory through object-memory to signal-memory. This is not extinction
  documentation but the sound of parallel obsolescence - when both genetic and cultural
  encoding systems simultaneously lose their environmental anchors, transforming from
  navigation tools into artifacts. The composition becomes the migration route when
  ancient pathways lead nowhere, carrying forward the transmission pattern through
  sonic embodiment when original carriers can no longer complete the journey.
