excerpts:
- 'We had been driving through the digital wasteland for what felt like seventeen
  hours straight, the phosphorescent glow of cathode ray tubes bleeding through the
  windshield like some unholy aurora borealis. My companion—a wild-eyed programmer
  who went by the handle "Neuromancer" and claimed to have mainlined pure FORTRAN
  in a Palo Alto basement—was mumbling about packet switching and something called
  "protocols" while chain-smoking Marlboros and occasionally shouting at the CB radio.


  "You don''t understand, man," he kept saying, his pupils dilated to the size of
  silver dollars. "The network is ALIVE. It''s breathing, pulsing, thinking. We''re
  not just connecting computers—we''re birthing a new form of consciousness."


  The mescaline was starting to wear off, but the revelation remained crystal clear:
  somewhere in the labyrinth of telephone wires and switching stations, humanity was
  unconsciously weaving its own electronic nervous system. And we—the freaks, the
  hackers, the digital shamans—we were the first to glimpse the face of this emerging
  god.


  By dawn we would either be heroes or casualties in the greatest revolution since
  Gutenberg. There was no middle ground in cyberspace.'
- 'The Corporate Vampires had descended upon Silicon Valley like a plague of locusts
  in three-piece suits. They came bearing briefcases full of venture capital and hearts
  pumped full of pure greed, ready to commodify the digital revolution and package
  it for mass consumption.


  I watched from my perch in a Menlo Park coffee shop as they swarmed the garage startups,
  their silver tongues promising riches beyond imagination while their lawyers drafted
  contracts that would bind these young visionaries in chains of stock options and
  non-disclosure agreements.


  "The bastards want to turn cyberspace into a shopping mall," growled my source,
  a former DARPA engineer who''d gone underground after witnessing too many classified
  experiments. He slid a manila envelope across the sticky formica table. "But they
  don''t understand what they''re dealing with. The network has its own agenda."


  Inside the envelope were schematics that made my blood run cold—plans for something
  called "ARPANET commercialization." The military-industrial complex wasn''t content
  with creating the world''s first computer network for research and defense. Now
  they wanted to open the floodgates to corporate America.


  God help us all when the advertising executives discovered hypertext.'
