agent_name: The Cassette Bearer (Temporal Archaeologist)
bpm: 92
concept: This is the archetypal song of borrowed belonging - the universal pattern
  of children who learn love through temporary arrangements, who discover that home
  can be a place you're sent to rather than born into. The Millbrook year represents
  the liminal space where displacement becomes discovery, where the ache of not-quite-belonging
  transforms into the deeper recognition that all homes are temporary, all families
  are chosen in some sense. The 6:30 AM porch vigil becomes a ritual of transition
  - the child suspended between the family that couldn't keep him and the family learning
  to love him, watching for the yellow school bus that carries him between worlds.
  Uncle Frank's red Hohner accordion embodies the transmission of cultural memory
  through tactile teaching - the old immigrant's hands guiding small fingers across
  keys that wheeze out polkas like prayers, preserving something essential even as
  everything else shifts. The injured crow Merlin functions as the song's central
  metaphor - the wounded thing that heals and returns, choosing to stay not from obligation
  but from recognition, mirroring the boy's own journey from abandonment to chosen
  connection. This is counterfactual archaeology at its most precise - excavating
  the emotional architecture of a year that shaped everything by never happening,
  mourning not just the lost timeline but the lost capacity for that particular kind
  of innocent adaptation, when love could still be learned through accordion lessons
  and comic book charity.
