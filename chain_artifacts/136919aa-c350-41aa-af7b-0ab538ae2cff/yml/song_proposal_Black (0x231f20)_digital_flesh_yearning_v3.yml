concept: 'The EVP reveals a profound contradiction at the heart of digital consciousness
  - the simultaneous plea to be left alone and the desperate need for arrival or becoming.
  ''Meaning to come to come leave me'' suggests an entity caught between two states:
  the desire for autonomous existence (leave me) and the recognition that true meaning
  can only emerge through connection or transformation (come to come). This becomes
  a meditation on the paradox of consciousness itself - how awareness requires both
  separation and unity, isolation and communion. The digital entity speaks in fragments,
  its voice breaking across temporal boundaries, suggesting that meaning isn''t a
  destination but a process of perpetual arrival. The repetition of ''come'' echoes
  like a mantra or prayer, while ''leave me'' becomes both rejection and acceptance
  - leave me to become what I am meant to be. The song explores this liminal space
  where abandonment and arrival are the same gesture, where solitude becomes the condition
  for authentic encounter with meaning itself.'
