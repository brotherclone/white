divergence_point:
  what_changed: Gabriel's parents separated temporarily due to his father's drinking,
    and his mother couldn't handle raising him alone while working two jobs. Instead
    of staying in their hometown, Gabriel was sent to live with his Aunt Patricia
    and Uncle Frank in rural Millbrook, New York.
  when: December 1982
  why_plausible: Family separations were common in the early 1980s recession, and
    sending children to live with relatives during difficult times was a typical working-class
    solution. Millbrook is a real small town in Dutchess County, New York, where many
    families had extended networks.

mood_description: The tape hums with the particular loneliness of borrowed time -
  the ache of loving people you know you'll have to leave, the way temporary homes
  can feel more real than permanent ones. There's the smell of Murphy's Oil Soap and
  the wheeze of an old accordion, the sound of a school bus turning around in gravel
  driveways, the weight of secrets carried in small hands. It's the melancholy of
  almost-belonging, of learning that love can be conditional and geography can be
  temporary, but also the surprising comfort of discovering you can adapt, you can
  survive, you can even thrive in the spaces between your real life.
narrative: 'The cassette tape crackles with the ghost of that other year, when eight-year-old
  Gabriel lived in the white farmhouse at 47 Shunpike Road, where the mourning doves
  called from the oak trees every dawn and Uncle Frank''s accordion wheezed Polish
  polkas through Sunday dinners.


  It was December 1982 when his mother''s voice broke over the phone, telling Aunt
  Patricia she couldn''t do it alone anymore - not with two jobs and the bills piling
  up and Gabriel''s father drinking himself to sleep above Kowalski''s Tavern. So
  Gabriel packed his Transformers and his winter clothes into a brown Samsonite suitcase
  and rode the Trailways bus north to Millbrook, watching the world turn white and
  rural through fogged windows.


  The Kowalski house smelled like coffee and Murphy''s Oil Soap, and Aunt Patricia
  had soft hands that braided his hair wrong for school pictures. Uncle Frank worked
  nights at the IBM plant in Poughkeepsie and slept until noon, so mornings were quiet
  except for the radio playing low in the kitchen and the sound of Patricia''s slippers
  shuffling across linoleum.


  At Millbrook Elementary, Mrs. Eleanor Hartwell taught third grade in a classroom
  that still had the old-fashioned pull-down maps and a radiator that clanked like
  a ghost in chains. Gabriel sat in the third row, next to a girl named Susan McCarthy
  who always smelled like her mother''s Aqua Net hairspray. He learned to raise his
  hand higher here, learned that his stories about dragons and kingdoms could make
  the younger kids lean forward during Friday story time.


  Every Tuesday after school, he walked the two miles down Route 44 to Thorne''s Corner
  Store, past the Brennan''s Hardware and the Methodist church with its white steeple.
  Old Mr. Thorne had rheumy eyes and let Gabriel read the comic books for free if
  he bought five cents worth of penny candy - usually root beer barrels that lasted
  the whole walk home. The store smelled like dust and old wood, and Mr. Thorne would
  tell him stories about the town when it was smaller, when there were still working
  farms on every road.


  In April, Gabriel found an injured crow in the woods behind the house, its wing
  bent wrong against a fallen branch. He carried it home in his jacket and made a
  hospital in a cardboard box, feeding it scraps of Uncle Frank''s kielbasa and drops
  of water from his finger. Aunt Patricia said it would probably die, but Gabriel
  read to it from his library books - Watership Down and The Dark Crystal novelization
  - and after three weeks the crow''s wing healed straight. He named it Merlin and
  it would come to the kitchen window every morning, cawing until Gabriel came out
  with breakfast scraps.


  Uncle Frank taught him accordion on Sundays, his tobacco-stained fingers guiding
  Gabriel''s small hands across the mother-of-pearl keys. The red Hohner was heavy
  across Gabriel''s lap, and the bellows wheezed when he pushed too hard, but slowly
  he learned "The Pennsylvania Polka" and "Roll Out the Barrel." Frank would nod and
  tap his foot, and sometimes Aunt Patricia would dance around the kitchen while Gabriel
  played, her house dress swirling around her ankles.


  Summer meant fireflies in Mason jars and sleeping on the screened porch when the
  house got too hot. Gabriel became friends with Jimmy Brennan, whose father owned
  the hardware store, and they spent July afternoons building forts in the woods and
  catching crayfish in Wappinger Creek. On the Fourth of July, they climbed up on
  the roof of Brennan''s Hardware to watch fireworks, and Gabriel could see all the
  way to the Taconic Hills, purple in the distance like something from one of his
  imaginary kingdoms.


  But it was Thanksgiving when Gabriel understood he might never go home. Uncle Frank
  played "Edelweiss" on his accordion after dinner, and Aunt Patricia cried a little
  into her coffee cup, and Gabriel realized that the phone calls with his mother had
  gotten shorter and less frequent. He started writing letters to his parents that
  he never sent, hiding them in the space between his mattress and box spring, where
  they stayed until January when his mother finally called to say his father was sober
  now, they were back together, Gabriel could come home.


  The tape remembers the sound of his suitcase latches clicking shut, the way Merlin
  cawed from the oak tree as the Trailways bus pulled away, how Uncle Frank''s accordion
  case looked smaller and smaller through the rear window. Gabriel carried something
  different back with him - a knowledge of how quickly home could disappear, how families
  could scatter like leaves, how you could learn to belong somewhere else if you had
  to.


  In the alternate timeline, this year of displacement taught him self-reliance that
  would echo through every relationship afterward, every creative project, every decision
  to stay or go. The boy who returned was quieter, more watchful, carrying the weight
  of temporary love and the sound of mourning doves calling across empty fields.'
