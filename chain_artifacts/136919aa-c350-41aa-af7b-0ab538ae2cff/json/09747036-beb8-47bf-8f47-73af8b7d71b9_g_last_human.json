adaptation_attempts:
- Tried to diversify into year-round ecotourism focusing on local birds and plants
- Applied for government reforestation grants to replant cleared areas
- Attempted to create a seed bank of native milkweed varieties
- Partnered with researchers tracking butterfly population collapse
- Started teaching traditional ecological knowledge online to preserve it

daily_routine: Every morning at 5 AM, Esperanza would walk the same forest paths her
  grandmother taught her, checking the oyamel fir trees for butterfly clusters. She'd
  prepare traditional hot chocolate with cinnamon for tourists, sharing stories in
  three languages about how her great-grandmother could predict the monarchs' arrival
  by the angle of morning light through the canopy. Now she walks empty trails, the
  silence broken only by chainsaws clearing land for more avocado trees.

- displacement
environmental_stressor: Habitat conversion of overwintering forests to avocado plantations,
  combined with climate-shifted migration timing that left sanctuaries empty during
  traditional tourist season
family_situation: Widowed mother of two adult children who moved to Mexico City for
  work. Her son sends money but can't return - the sanctuary closed, no jobs remain.
  Her daughter calls weekly, begging her to leave, but Esperanza refuses to abandon
  the forest where four generations of women in her family learned to read the butterflies'
  ancient language.

final_thought: She wondered if the butterflies could feel it too - that terrible disorientation
  when the world changes faster than memory can adapt, when the ancient pathways encoded
  in your bones suddenly lead nowhere.
last_days_scenario: 'Esperanza sits in her empty visitor center, surrounded by faded
  photographs of orange clouds of monarchs that once darkened the sky each winter.
  The last tourists left three weeks ago. Outside, she can hear the distant rumble
  of machinery clearing another hectare for avocado cultivation. Her phone buzzes
  with a message from a researcher in Canada: "Migration route completely disrupted.
  Population down 95%. May be functionally extinct." She sets down the carved butterfly
  her grandmother made, its paint worn smooth by four generations of hands. Tomorrow,
  the bank will foreclose on the sanctuary. Tonight, she''ll walk the empty trails
  one last time, speaking aloud the Purépecha names for each tree, each seasonal marker,
  each sacred site - words that will die with her, just like the butterflies'' ancient
  memory of how to find home.'

significant_object: A hand-carved wooden monarch butterfly made by her grandmother,
  painted with natural pigments. It was traditionally passed to the next generation
  when the butterflies returned each November. Now it sits unused on her kitchen table
  - there's no one left to receive it, and no butterflies to mark the season.
thread_id: 136919aa-c350-41aa-af7b-0ab538ae2cff
vulnerability_details: Like monarchs whose multi-generational migration was broken
  when climate disrupted timing, Esperanza's family's four-generation tradition of
  guiding monarch tourism ended when the butterflies stopped arriving. Her grandmother's
  indigenous Purépecha knowledge of seasonal timing became useless when spring arrived
  six weeks early three years running.
