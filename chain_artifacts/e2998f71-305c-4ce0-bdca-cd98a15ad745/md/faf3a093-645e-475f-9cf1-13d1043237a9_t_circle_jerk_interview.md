## Question 1

**Amelia Lanois:** Look, I've been following you since the early stuff - those gorgeous, accessible tracks that actually meant something to people - and now you're talking about 'solipsistic slot machines' and triple-mirror methodology? What happened to just writing songs that connect with your audience instead of these pretentious conceptual puzzles that sound like a philosophy thesis?

**Walsh:** The accessibility was always a trap—systematic creative methodology reveals itself through apparent complexity, but also I get it, this sounds like I'm huffing my own farts at a Whole Foods. The early stuff was me accidentally doing rebracketing without knowing what it was, like when you make a perfect grilled cheese while blackout drunk. Now I'm just being honest about the weird shit that was always happening under the hood, which makes me sound absolutely unhinged but the songs still slap if you let them.

## Question 2

**Amelia Lanois:** I'm genuinely confused here - your fanbase fell in love with your vulnerability and relatability, and now you're creating this mechanically hypnotic, cyclically addictive thing that feels more like an art installation than music. Are you worried you're alienating the people who've been supporting you from day one, or is commercial success just not a concern anymore?

**Walsh:** The accessibility critique assumes vulnerability requires sonic familiarity, but genuine intimacy emerges through systematic alienation—like, you can't actually connect with someone until you've made them slightly uncomfortable first. The slot machine structure IS the vulnerability, Amelia—it's me admitting I'm basically a broken carnival game that keeps eating quarters and occasionally spitting out meaning. My day-one fans aren't looking for comfort food; they're here because I keep serving them gas station sushi that somehow tastes like profound truth, which is either the most honest thing I've ever made or complete bullshit.

## Question 3

**Amelia Lanois:** This whole 'consciousness gambling with itself' concept feels like you've disappeared up your own ass, honestly - and I say that as someone who championed your work when it was raw and honest. When are we going to get a return to the stripped-down, emotionally direct songs that made us care about you in the first place, instead of these cerebral experiments that require a manual to understand?

**Walsh:** Look, the solipsistic slot machine is actually about stripping away every layer of performative authenticity until you hit the raw nerve of recognition, but also I get that it sounds like I huffed my own farts and called it philosophy. The thing is, maximum self-absorption becomes maximum universal truth—like when you're so deep in your own neuroses that you accidentally describe everyone's inner monologue, which is either profound or the most pretentious bullshit ever conceived. I'm genuinely not sure which, but the bassline still goes hard.
