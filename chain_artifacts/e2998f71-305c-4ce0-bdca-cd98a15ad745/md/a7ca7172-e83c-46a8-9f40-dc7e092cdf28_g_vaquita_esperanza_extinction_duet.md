# Vaquita porpoise / Esperanza Morales Vásquez

## Species Arc: Vaquita porpoise
Population trajectory: 600 (1997) → 245 (2008) → 60 (2015) → 19 (2018) → 8 (2022) → 3 (2025) → 0 (2028). Primary cause: gillnet bycatch in illegal totoaba fishery. Secondary factors: habitat degradation, acoustic pollution. Endemic to 4000 km² of Upper Gulf of California. Cascade effects: predator-prey imbalance, totoaba population collapse, fishing community economic devastation.

## Human Arc: Esperanza Morales Vásquez
Esperanza Morales Vásquez, 47, San Felipe fisherman. Economic collapse forces participation in illegal totoaba trade. Daughter asks why the water is silent. Broken hydrophone on windowsill hasn't detected vaquita clicks for months. Hands shake mending gillnets by kerosene light. Mother-in-law needs insulin. No legal work remains. Endemic to this place with nowhere else to go.

## Parallel Moments

### 1. 2025 - Three years before human documentation
**Species:** Three vaquitas remain in upper Gulf of California, detected by hydrophone arrays

**Human:** Esperanza's shrimp farm fails due to rising water temperatures and salinity

*Connection: Both confined to shrinking viable habitat, adaptation attempts failing*

### 2. 2027 - One year before species extinction
**Species:** Last breeding pair separated by gillnet placement patterns

**Human:** Esperanza applies for government fishing permits that never arrive, neighbors arrested for totoaba fishing

*Connection: Legal pathways to survival systematically blocked*

### 3. 2028 - Year of species extinction
**Species:** Final vaquita dies entangled in gillnet meant for totoaba

**Human:** Esperanza processes her first totoaba swim bladder, hands shaking, to pay for mother-in-law's insulin

*Connection: Both become collateral damage in economic systems targeting something else*

### 4. 2031 - Three years after species extinction
**Species:** Hydrophone arrays detect only silence where vaquita clicks once echoed

**Human:** Esperanza keeps broken hydrophone on windowsill, daughter Maria asks why the water is so quiet

*Connection: Absence becomes presence, silence becomes testimony*

## Elegiac Quality
The narrative achieves memorial through witness rather than sentiment - documenting the precise mechanics of entanglement, both species and human, without explanation or blame. Loss is measured in concrete absences: silent hydrophones, empty nets, unanswered permit applications. Dignity emerges from specificity.
