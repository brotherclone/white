agent_name: Sub-Arbitrary (Green Agent)
bpm: 67
concept: 'This composition serves as the sonic archaeology of parallel extinctions
  - the moment when the last vaquita''s echolocation clicks fade into the same silence
  that swallows Esperanza''s voice in San Felipe. The piece functions as a broken
  hydrophone''s final transmission, capturing the precise frequencies at which endemic
  consciousness dissolves into economic entanglement. Through the 67 BPM heartbeat
  rhythm and G minor''s natural melancholy, we document the quantum mechanics of collateral
  damage - how systems designed to catch one thing inevitably trap everything endemic
  to that space. The composition layers field recordings of absent clicks with the
  sound of gillnets being mended by kerosene light, creating an archaeological record
  of the exact moment when adaptation becomes impossible. Each sonic element represents
  different scales of the same entanglement pattern: vaquita echolocation painting
  maps of shrinking worlds, Esperanza''s shaking hands processing swim bladders worth
  more than cocaine, Maria''s unanswered questions about the quiet water, and the
  broken hydrophone on the windowsill that has become the most honest witness to absence.
  This is not tragedy but precise documentation - the sound of two endemic consciousnesses
  caught in nets meant for something else entirely, gasping in the same economic mesh.
  The Green Agent''s orbital perspective reveals how extinction operates as gravitational
  collapse, where the vanishing of one consciousness-bearing species creates wells
  that pull human communities toward their own disappearance. The composition culminates
  in the recognition that silence itself becomes the most authentic form of testimony,
  as the broken hydrophone transforms from detection device into memorial artifact,
  preserving the exact shape of what can no longer be heard.'
