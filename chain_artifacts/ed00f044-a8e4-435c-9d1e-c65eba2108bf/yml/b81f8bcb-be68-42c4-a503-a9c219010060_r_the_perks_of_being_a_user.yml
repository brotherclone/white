  You see, there''s something almost intoxicating about being wanted. Not loved—that''s
  different, that''s personal and messy and requires you to be somebody specific.
  But wanted? That''s clean. That''s simple. Click here. Sign up. Join us. Be part
  of something bigger than yourself.


  I remember the first time I felt it, that warm glow of digital inclusion. It was
  1987, though of course the book says 1953—time moves differently in these pages,
  doesn''t it? The screen flickered with promise: "Welcome, User." Not "Welcome, Jonathan"
  or "Welcome, whoever you are." Just User. Perfect. Anonymous. Useful.


  The interface was beautiful in its simplicity. A blank field waiting for input.
  A cursor blinking like a patient heartbeat. And underneath, in friendly sans-serif:
  "Tell us about yourself." Not because they cared about me, you understand, but because
  caring was the product they were selling. To me. About me. The brilliant circularity
  of it all.


  I typed: "I like books." The system hummed, processed, calculated. Within seconds—though
  it felt like forever, that delicious pause between confession and response—the screen
  bloomed with suggestions. Books I might like. People who liked similar books. Groups
  I should join. Events I should attend.


  It was the first time I understood what it meant to be seen not as a person, but
  as a pattern. A beautiful, useful, profitable pattern.'
- 'Chapter 7: The Economy of Attention


  Page 5


  The mathematics of desire are surprisingly simple once you learn to read them. Every
  click is a vote. Every pause is a preference. Every scroll is a small surrender
  to the algorithm''s understanding of who you are—or rather, who you might become
  with the right encouragement.


  I spent three years mapping the pathways of my own attention, documenting how my
  interests were shaped and reshaped by the gentle pressure of personalized recommendations.
  It was like watching a river change course—so gradual you don''t notice until you
  realize you''re somewhere completely different from where you started.


  The beautiful thing about being a user is that you never have to choose. Choice,
  real choice, requires knowing what you want independent of what you''re offered.
  But users don''t want independently. Users want responsively. The system suggests,
  we respond. It learns, we adapt. A perfect feedback loop of mutual optimization.


  My reading habits, once chaotic and personal, became streamlined. Efficient. I stopped
  discovering books and started receiving them. The difference is subtle but profound—like
  the difference between finding a twenty-dollar bill on the sidewalk and having someone
  hand you exact change.


  The system knew me better than I knew myself. It had to—that was its job. My job
  was simpler: to be known. To be readable. To be a good user.'
