text: 'FRANKLIN BOROUGH - Three members of local rock band "The Weight of Wanting"
  vanished during a late-night recording session at the abandoned Sterling Hill Mine
  facility, leaving behind only a partially completed tape and equipment still running
  when authorities arrived Saturday morning.


  The band - consisting of drummer Michael "Mick" Kowalski, 17, bassist Jennifer Chen,
  16, and guitarist Thomas Brennan, 18 - had been using the defunct mine''s echo chambers
  for unauthorized recording sessions since February, according to Franklin Borough
  Police Chief Robert Martinez.


  "The kids had been trespassing regularly," Martinez said. "We''d gotten complaints
  from neighbors about strange sounds coming from the mine at all hours, but when
  we''d check, we''d find nothing but their equipment set up in the tunnels."


  The discovery was made by mine security guard Harold Voss during his 6 AM rounds.
  Voss found the trio''s amplifiers, drums, and recording equipment still powered
  and running in the mine''s deepest accessible chamber, approximately 400 feet underground.
  A reel-to-reel tape machine contained a 23-minute recording that Voss described
  as "unlike anything I''d heard before."


  "It started normal enough - typical rock music," Voss said. "But around the 15-minute
  mark, something changed. The rhythm got... incomplete somehow. Like they were playing
  in a time signature that didn''t quite close. And there were these other sounds
  underneath - clicking, humming, like machinery talking to itself."


  Sussex County Sheriff''s Department launched a search of the mine''s extensive tunnel
  system, but found no trace of the missing teenagers. Their personal belongings,
  including wallets and car keys, remained with the equipment. The band''s 1971 Volkswagen
  van was found parked at the mine entrance with the engine still running.


  Perhaps most puzzling to investigators is the condition of the recording equipment
  itself. According to electronics technician Paul Hendricks, who examined the gear
  at the request of police, several modifications had been made to the amplifiers
  and mixing board.


  "Someone had wired these machines in ways I''ve never seen," Hendricks said. "There
  were additional circuits connected to what looked like surveillance microphones
  - the kind used in telephone systems. It''s like they were trying to record something
  beyond just their music."


  The teenagers had reportedly been experimenting with what Chen''s mother described
  as "consciousness music" - compositions designed to alter perception through specific
  frequencies and rhythms. Mrs. Chen found notebooks in her daughter''s room containing
  detailed mathematical calculations related to sound waves and their effects on brain
  activity.


  "Jenny had been reading about government mind control experiments," Mrs. Chen said.
  "She was convinced that certain sound frequencies could break people free from what
  she called ''surveillance consciousness.'' I thought it was just teenage rebellion."


  The band had gained a small following among local youth for their unconventional
  performances, which often featured extended instrumental sections and unusual time
  signatures. Several attendees at their last public performance at the Franklin Borough
  Community Center in February reported feeling "disconnected from time" during the
  show.


  "It was like the music made you aware that you were being watched," said audience
  member Sarah McKenzie, 16. "Not by people in the room, but by something bigger.
  It made me want to disappear too."


  State Police have classified the case as a missing persons investigation, though
  they acknowledge the unusual circumstances make conventional search methods challenging.
  The mine''s complex tunnel system extends for miles underground, with many passages
  unmapped since the facility''s closure in 1986.


  The recovered recording has been turned over to state authorities for analysis.
  A spokesperson for the State Police declined to comment on the tape''s contents,
  citing the ongoing investigation.


  Mine owner Sterling Hill Mining Company issued a statement emphasizing that the
  facility has been properly secured and that the teenagers were trespassing illegally.
  The company has since installed additional fencing around the property.


  The disappearance has sent shockwaves through Franklin Borough''s tight-knit community,
  where the three teenagers were known as academically gifted but increasingly troubled
  by what teachers described as "existential concerns" about surveillance and social
  control.


  "They kept talking about finding cracks in the system," said Franklin High School
  music teacher Dorothy Walsh. "I thought they meant the music industry. Now I wonder
  if they meant something else entirely."


  Anyone with information about the whereabouts of Michael Kowalski, Jennifer Chen,
  or Thomas Brennan is asked to contact the Sussex County Sheriff''s Department at
  (201) 948-5000.


  The Sterling Hill Mine remains closed to the public, though neighbors report that
  strange sounds continue to emanate from the facility during late night hours - sounds
  that some describe as resembling the incomplete rhythms found on the band''s final
  recording.'
