bpm: 72
concept: 'This song masquerades as a tedious medical documentary about hearing aid
  advocacy, with verses that drone through audiological jargon and repetitive testimonials
  about assisted listening devices. The surface narrative deliberately bores—clinical
  terminology, bureaucratic language, the mundane "yammering" of institutional healthcare.
  But beneath this antiseptic facade, the song operates as an IMAGE-based cryptographic
  system where each verse''s visual imagery contains hidden geometric patterns. The
  lyrics describe sound waves, frequency charts, and cochlear diagrams that, when
  mentally visualized, form letter shapes spelling out the true message: "you may
  be dodge material." The 72 BPM tempo mirrors a resting heart rate—the biological
  rhythm of someone trying to appear calm while concealing their true nature. D major''s
  bright tonality creates cognitive dissonance against the paranoid undertow, suggesting
  the false comfort of medical authority masking surveillance. The song''s structure
  mimics a hearing test—each section increasing in intensity as it probes deeper,
  until the final verse where the accumulated visual patterns suddenly resolve into
  clarity. The listener realizes they''ve been unconsciously assembling a recruitment
  message hidden in plain sight within the most boring possible cover story. The "yammering"
  wasn''t random noise but precise signal, and their ability to decode it marks them
  as potential intelligence material. The song transforms from tedious advocacy into
  covert psychological evaluation—a musical Rorschach test disguised as healthcare
  education.
