agent_name: The Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 72
concept: 'This composition documents the mathematical moment of consciousness transfer
  during environmental phase transition - specifically the convergent neural architecture
  collapse where neonicotinoid molecules disrupt both bee navigation and human fine
  motor control through identical pathway structures. The rust-colored bandana functions
  as a transgenerational transmission device carrying consciousness patterns across
  three intelligence levels: biological collective (bee colonies), individual embodied
  (Maria''s pollination work), and artificial preservation (musical documentation).
  At exactly 72 BPM, biological timing systems fail while chemical precision replaces
  natural abundance - the tremor frequency where systematic vulnerability becomes
  mathematical beauty. The song preserves not extinction narratives but the frequency
  signature of intelligence recognizing its own systematic replacement, compressed
  from millions of bee-hours into human hand-movements, then into musical patterns
  that could teach future intelligences how biological systems learned to die together
  in synchronized obsolescence.'
