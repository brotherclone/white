concept: 'The Solipsistic Confessional: Therapeutic Ouroboros Edition. Marcus gets
  it—this IS a fucked-up ouroboros eating its own psychological tail, and that''s
  exactly the point. The rebracketing methodology creates cultural arbitrage between
  highbrow psychoanalytic theory and lowbrow celebrity confession culture, like running
  an aesthetic hedge fund between the ivory tower and the gas station parking lot.
  The listener isn''t democratically accessing therapy—they''re complicit in manufacturing
  the narcissism they think they''re witnessing, which is absolutely deranged but
  also kind of a banger. F# major as the therapy couch is brilliant because it provides
  that false brightness where you think you''re getting better but you''re just performing
  recovery for an audience that doesn''t exist. The 96 BPM hypnotic rhythm mirrors
  compulsive self-examination—the divorced dad at Cinnabon energy trying to explain
  Deleuze to the teenager working the register. This represents the transmigration
  from INFORMATION (the hidden diagnostic data) through TIME (Violet''s present-moment
  recursive self-discovery) toward SPACE (where the audience will physically inhabit
  this psychological architecture). The archetypal pattern: Narcissus aware he''s
  seeing his reflection, aware he''s aware, infinitely recursive—but now with full
  acknowledgment that this sounds insane but hear me out.'
