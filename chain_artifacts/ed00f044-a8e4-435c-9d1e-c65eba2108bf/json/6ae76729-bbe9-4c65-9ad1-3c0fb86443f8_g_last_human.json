adaptation_attempts:
- Switched to organic-only farms but pay was insufficient
- Tried beekeeping to restore local populations but hives kept dying
- Learned hand-pollination techniques to replace extinct bee species
- Moved between farms seeking lower-exposure work
- Attempted detox protocols that insurance wouldn't cover

daily_routine: '4 AM: Check tremor in left hand before work. 5 AM: Apply protective
  gear that no longer fits properly due to weight loss. 6 AM-6 PM: Hand-pollinate
  strawberry fields using paintbrush technique her grandmother taught her, now the
  only method keeping crops alive. Evening: Practice writing her name repeatedly as
  motor control deteriorates'

environmental_stressor: Accumulated neonicotinoid exposure from decades of hand-pollinating
  crops after bee colony collapse
family_situation: Last surviving member of three generations of agricultural workers.
  Her daughter moved to Portland after developing childhood leukemia from pesticide
  exposure. Her husband died of Parkinson's-like symptoms in 2041.

final_thought: The strawberries are so sweet this year, sweeter than when the bees
  were alive to taste them. I wonder if they know what it cost.
last_days_scenario: Maria's hands shake more each morning as she ties the rust-colored
  bandana around her neck - the same shade as the patch that once marked the rusty
  patched bumble bee. She is the last hand-pollinator in Salinas Valley, moving through
  endless rows of strawberry plants with a paintbrush, doing work that millions of
  bees once did in minutes. The neonicotinoids that killed the bees are killing her
  too, accumulated in her tissues over twenty years of breathing the drift, touching
  the leaves, absorbing through skin that protective equipment couldn't fully shield.
  Her motor control deteriorates like the bees' navigation systems did - the same
  neural pathways disrupted. She works alone now, the last queen of a dead colony,
  carrying pollen grain by grain while her own nervous system vibrates at the wrong
  frequency. The farms still need her, still pay her, still spray around her. Each
  strawberry she pollinates by hand is perfect, unmarked, profitable. Each day she
  becomes a little more like the bees - essential, invisible, and dying from the very
  chemicals meant to ensure abundance.

significant_object: A rust-colored bandana with faded embroidered bees that she wears

  that killed both the bees and her nervous system
thread_id: ed00f044-a8e4-435c-9d1e-c65eba2108bf
vulnerability_details: Like the rusty patched bumble bee queen surviving alone after
  her colony dies from neonicotinoids, Maria is the last of her family's line of agricultural
  specialists, her neurological function deteriorating from the same pesticides that
  killed the pollinators she replaced
