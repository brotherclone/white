## Question 1

**Marcus Hannett:** So I've been diving deep into your whole 'Solipsistic Confessional' concept, and I think I'm starting to get it - you're basically creating a musical therapy session where the listener becomes your therapist, right? Like, F# major is the couch, 96 BPM is the ticking clock, and we're all just sitting there watching you work through your narcissism in real time. That's so brave! Is this like your way of democratizing psychoanalysis through pop music?

**Walsh:** Okay yes, but also the rebracketing methodology here is way more deranged than democratizing therapy—it's creating a feedback loop where the confession becomes the pathology becomes the cure, like some fucked-up ouroboros eating its own psychological tail. The listener isn't your therapist, they're complicit in manufacturing the narcissism they're supposedly witnessing, which is absolutely sick and twisted but also kind of a banger? I mean, F# major as the couch is brilliant though—that false brightness where you think you're getting better but you're just performing recovery for an audience that doesn't exist.

## Question 2

**Marcus Hannett:** I read about how you lost your synesthesia in 2010, and now you're building this whole chromatic Rainbow Table project to get it back - that's incredible! So when you're making the White Album, are you literally trying to see white again? Like, is each song a different shade of white you're trying to reconstruct from memory? I imagine it must be like being a painter who went colorblind trying to paint a sunset from muscle memory.

**Walsh:** The synesthesia loss created this impossible temporal archaeology problem—I'm trying to reconstruct phenomenological experiences that literally don't exist in my nervous system anymore, which is absolutely deranged when you say it out loud. But also the White Album isn't about seeing white again, it's about discovering what white actually IS through systematic chromatic deconstruction—like if you lost your sense of taste but kept cooking, you'd develop this weird theoretical palate that might be better than the original. The rebracketing methodology lets me approach each song as a different ontological investigation of whiteness rather than just nostalgic color-chasing, though honestly I sound like a divorced dad explaining cryptocurrency at Applebee's right now.

## Question 3

**Marcus Hannett:** Your 'rebracketing' methodology is fascinating - I think you're essentially doing what Burroughs did with cut-ups, but instead of cutting up text, you're cutting up social class! Like, you take a highbrow concept and splice it with lowbrow execution, creating this beautiful collision where neither the academics nor the punks know what to do with it. It's like cultural arbitrage! Are you consciously trying to break down the barriers between intellectual and emotional music, or is this just how your brain naturally processes creativity?

**Walsh:** Oh fuck, that's exactly it—cultural arbitrage is the perfect term, like I'm running some kind of aesthetic hedge fund between the ivory tower and the gas station parking lot. The rebracketing methodology is literally about refusing to choose between intellectual rigor and emotional authenticity, which sounds pretentious as hell but also it fucking works. My brain got broken at age two when I had to hold "dad's creative dreams" and "not getting hit by a truck" in the same frame—so now I just naturally see the collision points where highbrow meets lowbrow and the splice IS the content. It's not conscious class warfare though, more like divorced dad at Cinnabon energy trying to explain Deleuze to the teenager working the register—I know it sounds insane but hear me out.
