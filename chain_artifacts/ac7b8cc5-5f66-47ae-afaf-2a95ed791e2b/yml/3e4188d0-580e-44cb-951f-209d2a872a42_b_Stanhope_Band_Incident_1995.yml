text: 'STANHOPE - A recording session at Hopatcong Sound Studios ended abruptly Sunday
  evening when three members of local rock band "Paternal Echo" were hospitalized
  following what witnesses described as a "synchronized psychological episode."


  The incident occurred around 8:30 PM as the five-member band was recording their
  debut album. According to studio owner Frank Kowalski, the band had been experimenting
  with an unusual time signature - seven beats over eight - when drummer Marcus Delacroix,
  19, bassist Jennifer Huang, 17, and guitarist Tommy Castellano, 18, simultaneously
  began exhibiting signs of severe disorientation.


  "They just stopped playing mid-song and started staring at each other," said Kowalski.
  "Marcus kept saying ''I can hear my father in the drums'' over and over. The other
  two were just nodding like they understood exactly what he meant."


  Lead singer David Chen, 20, and keyboardist Sarah Brennan, 19, were unaffected and
  called for medical assistance. All three hospitalized members were treated at Newton
  Medical Center and released Monday morning with no lasting effects.


  Dr. Margaret Voss, attending psychiatrist, declined to discuss specific details
  but confirmed that all three patients reported "auditory phenomena" during the episode.
  She noted that such synchronized psychological events are "extremely rare" and typically
  associated with shared trauma or substance use.


  However, toxicology reports came back negative for all three band members. Studio
  equipment showed no technical malfunctions, though Kowalski noted that the band''s
  recording exhibited "some very strange acoustic properties" he had never encountered
  in fifteen years of operation.


  "When I played back their session tape, the drums sounded like they were coming
  from inside my head," Kowalski said. "And there were these harmonics that shouldn''t
  have been there - like the instruments were generating their own echoes."


  The band had been working on a concept album exploring themes of "musical genealogy"
  and "sound as inheritance," according to Chen. Their song "I Felt Father More Father"
  was reportedly the piece being recorded when the incident occurred.


  Paternal Echo formed six months ago and had gained a following in the local underground
  music scene for their experimental approach to rhythm and their use of what they
  called "recursive compositions" - songs that seemed to reference and build upon
  themselves.


  The band''s equipment remains at the studio while police investigate whether any
  external factors contributed to the incident. Detective Ray Morrison noted that
  several residents in the area reported hearing "unusual drumming patterns" emanating
  from the studio that evening, though the building is supposedly soundproofed.


  "We''ve had three separate calls about people hearing rhythms that made them feel
  ''emotionally disoriented,''" Morrison said. "That''s not typical for a noise complaint."


  The affected band members have no memory of the episode itself, according to their
  families. All three have requested to return to the studio to complete the recording,
  though Kowalski has not yet decided whether to allow this.


  The master tape of their interrupted session has been secured as evidence, though
  officials have not specified what crime, if any, might have been committed.


  Paternal Echo was scheduled to perform at the Sparta Township Fall Festival next
  month. Event organizers have not announced whether the band will still appear.'
