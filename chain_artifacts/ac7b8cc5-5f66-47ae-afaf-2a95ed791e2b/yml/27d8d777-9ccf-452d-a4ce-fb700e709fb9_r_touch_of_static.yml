- 'CHAPTER III: THE FREQUENCY OF FEAR


  The oscilloscope traced its green serpentine across the darkened laboratory as Dr.
  Margaret Voss adjusted the dials with trembling fingers. Three weeks had passed
  since the first transmission, and still the static persisted—not random, never random,
  but pulsing with an intelligence that defied every principle she''d learned at Bell
  Labs.


  "The carrier wave maintains a consistent 1.47 megahertz," she whispered into her
  tape recorder, the mechanical whir a comfort against the laboratory''s oppressive
  silence. "But the modulation... Christ, the modulation follows patterns I''ve never
  seen. It''s as if something is trying to speak through the interference itself."


  She pressed her headphones tighter against her ears. There—beneath the crackling
  wash of electromagnetic noise—something that might have been words. Or screaming.
  The distinction grew harder to make with each passing hour.


  The government men would return tomorrow. They''d promised as much when they''d
  sealed off Building C and posted the guards. But Margaret knew what they didn''t:
  the transmission wasn''t coming from outside. It was coming from within the very
  fabric of the radio spectrum itself, as if the air had learned to whisper secrets
  too terrible for human ears.


  She reached for the frequency dial once more, her wedding ring clicking against
  the metal. Somewhere in that ocean of static lay an answer. She was certain of it.
  Almost as certain as she was that finding it would destroy her.'
- 'CHAPTER VII: THE LISTENERS


  Eddie Kowalski had been monitoring the airwaves since he was twelve, when his father
  brought home that first Philco radio from the factory. Now, at thirty-four, he knew
  every legitimate frequency from coast to coast, every ham operator''s call sign,
  every late-night DJ''s nervous habits. But this... this was different.


  It started three months ago as a whisper between stations—just a flutter of noise
  that made him adjust his headphones and wonder if the tubes were going bad. But
  the static had personality. It breathed. It waited. And sometimes, in the dead hours
  before dawn, it almost seemed to recognize him.


  "You hear it too, don''t you?" The voice belonged to Mrs. Chen from the apartment
  upstairs. She stood in his doorway clutching a small transistor radio, her eyes
  red-rimmed from sleepless nights. "Channel 7.2. Right between the classical station
  and that new rock station."


  Eddie nodded slowly. He''d been cataloging the reports for weeks now—letters from
  radio operators in Kansas City, phone calls from housewives in Detroit, telegrams
  from ship captains in the Atlantic. All describing the same phenomenon: a presence
  in the static, something that listened back.


  "It knows our names," Mrs. Chen whispered. "Last night, I swear it said my daughter''s
  name. The daughter I lost in Shanghai, twenty years ago."


  Eddie''s hands found the tuning knob of his Hallicrafters receiver. The needle swept
  across the dial like a compass seeking magnetic north, and there it was—that familiar
  electric whisper, patient as death, intimate as prayer.'
