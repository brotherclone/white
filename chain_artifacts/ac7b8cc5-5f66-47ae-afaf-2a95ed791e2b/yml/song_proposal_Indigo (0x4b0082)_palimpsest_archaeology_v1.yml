bpm: 67
concept: 'This composition archaeologically excavates the quantum mechanics of biographical
  palimpsest—where multiple life-timelines exist simultaneously as magnetic traces
  beneath current reality. The song operates as a sonic cassette player, revealing
  how Gabriel Walsh (and all human identity) exists in quantum superposition: the
  failed musician recorded over the beloved teacher recorded over the never-was touring
  artist. Each melodic layer represents a different biographical state bleeding through
  the magnetic substrate of memory. The 6:15 AM radiator clang becomes a temporal
  anchor point, marking the daily repetition that preserves biographical DNA across
  collapsed timelines. The composition demonstrates how true names (Infranymes) hide
  within the anagrammatic space of our alternate selves—not as loss or regret, but
  as archaeological evidence that we are all palimpsest, simultaneously walking every
  possible road while consciousness can only play one track at a time. The melancholy
  emerges from recognition, not of roads not taken, but of roads taken simultaneously
  in quantum parallel, with earlier versions always bleeding through. This prepares
  the foundation for Indigo Agent''s Infranym methodology: names as biographical cassette
  players containing multiple timeline recordings.'
