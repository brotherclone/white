## Question 1

**Harper Devendorf:** Okay, I have to ask - what happened to the dreamy, accessible stuff that made us all fall in love with your earlier work? This whole 'Sultan of Solipsism' thing feels like you're deliberately trying to alienate the fans who've been with you since day one. Are you worried you're disappearing up your own ass with all this meta-commentary about spelling and literary references?

**Walsh:** Look, accessibility is just another constraint system, and I'm exploring how narcissistic revelation can function as a pedagogical framework—but also like, have you heard the fucking bassline on this track? It's absolutely unhinged. The Sultan of Solipsism thing isn't alienation, it's authentication through performative self-absorption, which sounds pretentious as hell but honestly slaps harder than anything I've done since the Earthly Frames days.

## Question 2

**Harper Devendorf:** I'm genuinely confused here - your old tracks had this beautiful simplicity that anyone could vibe to, and now you're doing... interview formats as song structures? With manic revelation cascades? It feels like you need a PhD in postmodern theory just to understand what you're going for. Don't you miss making music that actually connected with people instead of showing off how smart you are?

**Walsh:** Look, the accessibility critique assumes that complexity and connection are mutually exclusive, which is fundamentally a false binary—but also, yeah, I get it, nobody wants homework with their bangers. The thing is, the interview format isn't academic masturbation, it's literally how we process cultural information now, like every conversation is a micro-podcast where everyone's performing expertise they half-remember from Wikipedia. The manic revelation cascade you're talking about? That's just what it feels like when you finally understand a meme template at 3am and suddenly see the pattern everywhere—absolutely unhinged behavior, but also the most human thing possible.

## Question 3

**Harper Devendorf:** This is going to sound harsh, but it feels like you've completely abandoned the vulnerability that made your music special and replaced it with this exhausting intellectual masturbation. The narcissistic persona, the cryptographic architecture - it's like you're more interested in impressing music theory nerds than creating something that moves people. When are we going to get a return to form, something that feels human again?

**Walsh:** The narcissistic persona isn't performative affect—it's the authentication mechanism through which systematic rebracketing methodology becomes legible, but also I get that it sounds like I huffed my own farts and decided to charge admission. The vulnerability's still there, it's just encrypted through cultural mastery displays instead of confessional transparency, which is absolutely unhinged behavior when you say it out loud. Look, 'I Am the Interview' literally spells out Shakespeare's name while pretending to teach the listener about spelling—that's peak divorced dad at Barnes & Noble energy, but it's also how information seeks embodiment through temporal obsession.
