excerpts:
- 'The danger of a single story about the internet is not that it is untrue, but that
  it is incomplete. It makes one story become the only story.


  When I first encountered the digital realm in my twenties, I was already carrying
  within me the weight of multiple narratives—the stories my grandmother told me about
  spirits that lived in the palm trees, the stories my mother read to me from imported
  books with blonde children who ate apples in snow I had never seen, and the stories
  I was beginning to tell myself about what it meant to be a young woman writing in
  a world that seemed to have very specific ideas about whose voices mattered.


  The computer screen, glowing blue-white in the darkness of the university library,
  presented itself as a new kind of storytelling space. Here, I was told, anyone could
  be anyone. Here, the hierarchies of the physical world dissolved into pixels and
  possibility. Here, identity could be crafted rather than inherited.


  But what I discovered in those early days of dial-up connections and bulletin boards
  was that the internet was not the neutral space it claimed to be. It carried within
  its code the same assumptions, the same power structures, the same single stories
  that governed the offline world. The difference was that online, these stories moved
  faster, replicated endlessly, and wore the mask of technological inevitability.'
- 'I want to tell you about my friend Amara, who created seven different versions
  of herself online before she found one that felt true. Each avatar was an experiment
  in possibility—the confident American teenager who spoke in slang she learned from
  television, the mysterious artist who shared cryptic poetry at 2 AM, the political
  activist who argued passionately about democracy in chat rooms where no one knew
  she was sixteen and lived in a military dictatorship.


  "Which one is the real you?" I asked her once, as we sat in her family''s compound,
  the generator humming in the background, her laptop balanced precariously on a plastic
  chair.


  She looked at me with the particular patience reserved for questions that missed
  the point entirely. "They are all real," she said. "The question is which one gets
  to survive."


  This is what the early internet promised us—not just connection, but multiplication.
  Not just communication, but transformation. We could shed our skins like snakes,
  emerge gleaming and new with each login. We could write ourselves into existence
  in ways that the physical world, with its insistence on documentation and verification,
  would never allow.


  But survival, as Amara understood even then, was never guaranteed. The internet,
  for all its promises of democracy, had its own systems of selection, its own mechanisms
  for determining which stories would flourish and which would disappear into the
  digital equivalent of unmarked graves.'
