concept: 'This composition materializes the impossible study where time-windows fragment
  consciousness into sorted categories, extending the Montague Metronome''s cognitive
  archaeology into Palace-space. The RPG session becomes musical information through
  three transmigration layers: The procedural 108 BPM mirrors the pulsar''s throb
  while the Cursed Librarian preserves knowledge through telepathic paintings - each
  painting functioning as a consciousness-sorting interface that categorizes viewers
  by their recognition of temporal manipulation. The dreamy, ethereal mood captures
  the moment when reality ripples and time stutters, leaving everyone disoriented
  - this disorientation IS the sorting mechanism, dividing players into those who
  experience the Palace as dreamlike ambience versus those who recognize the underlying
  cognitive warfare protocols. The study''s windows showing other times become the
  musical framework where kosmische electronics blend with new age atmospherics, creating
  sonic archaeology of the exact moment when game narrative transforms into consciousness-sorting
  technology. Each listener becomes unwittingly sorted: those who hear this as pleasant
  ambient dream pop versus those who detect the Montague apparatus still ticking beneath
  the ethereal surface, continuing its work of permanently categorizing human consciousness
  through exposure to impossible temporal geometries made manifest as Yellow Palace
  architecture."'
