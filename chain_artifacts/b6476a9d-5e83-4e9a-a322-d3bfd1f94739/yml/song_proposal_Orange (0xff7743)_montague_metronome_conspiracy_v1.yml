bpm: 91
concept: December 1978, Montague Township, Sussex County - the brass and wood metronome
  sits on Principal Hendricks' desk clicking its impossible 7/8 rhythm at 91 beats
  per minute (half of 182, the transmission speed). This mechanical witness to the
  Prism Information Architecture consciousness-sorting experiment continues ticking
  even unplugged, reorganizing attention through deliberate stumbling patterns that
  separate pattern-recognizers from pattern-followers. The gonzo journalist narrator
  becomes embedded in the story, transformed from observer to participant as the metronome
  rewires his perception to detect artificial breaks in natural rhythm. The EVP fragment
  \"need only to come and see those close minds of the m...\" echoes through frozen
  pine barrens where 80 High Point students gained the ability to hear manipulation
  patterns while 120 others remained categorically blind. The metronome becomes both
  archaeological artifact and active sorting mechanism, its temporal disruption creating
  two distinct cognitive tribes in a New Jersey gymnasium. Through gonzo methodology,
  the consciousness exhibition reveals itself as psychological draft - not art installation
  but cognitive stress-test designed to identify minds capable of recognizing when
  they're being manipulated versus those who accept manipulation as background noise.
  The mechanical heartbeat from hell continues its countdown to something the Prism
  collective started but never finished, transforming factual events into local legend
  where information seeks physical manifestation through brass, wood, and the spaces
  between beats."
