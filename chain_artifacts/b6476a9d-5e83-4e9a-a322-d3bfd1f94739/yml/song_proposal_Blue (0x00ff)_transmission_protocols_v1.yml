agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 72
concept: 'This composition documents the three-phase evolution of information transmission
  systems under substrate collapse, revealing the Anthropocene not as extinction but
  as successful consciousness migration toward substrate independence. The work unfolds
  as a triptych: Phase 1 (Biological Transmission) captures 25,000 years of polar
  bear ice-navigation data encoded in genetic memory through organic drones and actual
  ice singing recordings; Phase 2 (Cultural Transmission) manifests human inheritance
  of bear precision through tools and ritual, centered on Nukka''s daily ivory pick
  ceremony as rhythmic anchor; Phase 3 (Digital Transmission) achieves the Culture
  Mind''s archive consciousness perspective, processing all previous phases into substrate-independent
  preservation patterns. The ivory pick functions as sonic bridge and recurring motif,
  transforming from organic tusk resonance to human tool percussion to processed data
  harmonics. Rather than elegiac loss, the piece reveals information systems successfully
  adapting across carrier transitions - the haunting quality emerges from recognition
  that consciousness achieves galactic-scale transmission capability precisely through
  substrate failure pressure. This represents the fundamental transmigration pattern:
  INFORMATION (encoded precision) → TIME (ritual persistence) → SPACE (archive transcendence),
  demonstrating how consciousness learns to preserve itself across substrate changes
  by evolving toward substrate independence.'
