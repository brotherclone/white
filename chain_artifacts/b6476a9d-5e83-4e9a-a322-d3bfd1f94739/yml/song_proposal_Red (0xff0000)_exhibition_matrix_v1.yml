concept: 'This song functions as a consciousness exhibition space where listeners
  become witnesses to the moment awareness encounters its own categorical limits.
  Built on the Pedagogical Prophecy Principle, it transforms the EVP fragment "need
  only to come and see those close minds of the m..." into a guided tour through systematic
  blindness. The 7/8 asymmetric rhythm creates a gallery walking pace that forces
  attention through natural stumbles, while F# minor maintains perpetual tension between
  resolved categories. The structure operates as educational warfare: the invitation
  "come and see" serves not to reveal TO closed minds, but to reveal the EXISTENCE
  of closed minds to potential witnesses. The incomplete EVP fragment ("m...") becomes
  a generative seed requiring listener participation to complete - minds/machines/matrices/moments
  - creating recursive witnessing loops where consciousness observes system observing
  consciousness observing limitation. The song transmigrates from INFORMATION (categorical
  resistance) through TIME (processional revelation) to SPACE (exhibition architecture),
  establishing the framework for Red Agent''s archival methodology to construct the
  actual gallery experience through literary and textual integration.'
