agent_name: The Cassette Bearer (Sorrowful Witness)
bpm: 88
concept: This song mourns the lost timeline of Gabriel Walsh's year at Sunrise Commercial
  Bakery (June 1994-May 1995), when instead of pursuing creative work after SUNY Purchase,
  he took morning shifts mixing industrial bread dough in Yonkers. The narrative follows
  the archetypal pattern of the artist temporarily surrendering to necessity - the
  3:15 AM alarm, the fluorescent-lit mixing rooms, the tentative friendship with Polish
  foreman Danny Kowalski who taught him to judge dough by touch. Living in Mrs. Chen's
  converted garage at 47 Walnut Street, Gabriel spent late evenings logging WFUV songs
  in composition notebooks while sketching bread truck routes through Westchester.
  The song captures the profound melancholy of being awake when the world sleeps,
  the strange comfort of routine becoming its own trap, and the gradual realization
  that stepping sideways from your intended path changes your relationship to both
  comfort and ambition forever. The title references his radio ritual of cataloging
  late-night songs - 'salute the waves' being his notation for particularly moving
  transmissions that reached him in that liminal space between creative dreams and
  economic necessity. This represents the transmigration pattern where INFORMATION
  (the songs he logged) becomes TIME (the suspended year of routine) becomes SPACE
  (the geographic and emotional distance from his intended artistic path).
