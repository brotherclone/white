text: 'MONTAGUE TOWNSHIP - An experimental art installation at High Point Regional
  High School has prompted an investigation after students reported being "automatically
  sorted into different groups" following exposure to what organizers called a "consciousness
  exhibition."


  The installation, titled "Gallery of Closed Minds," was presented Tuesday evening
  in the school gymnasium by a collective calling itself "Prism Information Architecture."
  The event, approved as an educational demonstration, featured what witnesses described
  as "industrial sounds mixed with voices that weren''t quite there" played at precisely
  68 beats per minute in an unusual 7/8 time signature.


  According to Principal Robert Hendricks, approximately 200 students attended the
  90-minute presentation. "Within hours, we noticed something peculiar," Hendricks
  said. "The students had naturally divided themselves into two distinct groups with
  very different reactions to what they''d experienced."


  Student Jennifer Morrison, 17, described her experience as "just weird art that
  made no sense." She and roughly 60% of attendees expressed similar sentiments, dismissing
  the installation as "pretentious" and "boring."


  However, the remaining students reported a markedly different experience. "I realized
  I was being tested," said senior Mark Kowalski. "The whole thing was designed to
  see how we''d respond. Some of us figured it out, and some didn''t."


  The installation featured what organizers called "EVP integration" - electronic
  voice phenomena that created incomplete phrases requiring listeners to "fill in
  the gaps." The most commonly reported fragment was described as "need only to come
  and see those close minds of the m..." with the ending left deliberately unclear.


  Dr. Patricia Vance, a psychiatrist consulted by the school district, noted the unusual
  nature of the response pattern. "It''s as if the installation functioned as some
  kind of cognitive sorting mechanism," she said. "The students who recognized they
  were being categorized showed markedly different brain wave patterns when tested."


  The Prism collective departed immediately after the presentation, leaving behind
  only a manifesto stating their intention to "construct consciousness exhibition
  spaces through sonic architecture." Attempts to locate the group have been unsuccessful.


  School board member Thomas Chen expressed concern about the lasting effects. "These
  students are still divided into their two groups weeks later," he said. "It''s like
  the installation permanently altered how they perceive reality."


  The New Jersey Department of Education has launched an inquiry into how the group
  obtained approval for the demonstration. Meanwhile, several students report continuing
  to hear the incomplete voice fragments during quiet moments.


  "The strangest part," said student Maria Santos, who experienced the "sorting" effect,
  "is that we can identify each other immediately now. It''s like we''re operating
  on a different frequency."


  The gymnasium has been closed pending acoustic testing after maintenance staff reported
  "rhythmic disruptions" that seem to occur in 7/8 time, even when the space is empty.


  Sussex County Sheriff''s Department spokesman Lt. David Pierce confirmed they are
  investigating reports of "consciousness-altering activities" but declined to elaborate
  on the nature of the inquiry.


  The installation''s effects appear to be permanent, with the two student groups
  maintaining distinct behavioral patterns and worldviews months after exposure. School
  officials are considering bringing in federal researchers to study what they''re
  now calling "The Montague Phenomenon."'
