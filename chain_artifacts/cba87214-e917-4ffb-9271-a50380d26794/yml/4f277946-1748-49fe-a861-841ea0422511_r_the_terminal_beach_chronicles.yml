excerpts:
- 'The coordinates shift again. Marisol finds herself standing in what was once the
  lobby of the Hotel Pacifica, now a crystalline maze of salt deposits and rusted
  chrome. The Geiger counter in her pocket clicks with the rhythm of a dying heart—seventeen
  beats, pause, seventeen beats. She knows this pattern. It''s the same cadence that
  haunted the dreams of the Bikini test subjects, the ones who survived long enough
  to dream.


  Through the fractured windows, the lagoon stretches endlessly, its surface broken
  by the skeletal remains of luxury yachts and military vessels. Each wreck marks
  another failed attempt to map the Terminal Beach, another expedition consumed by
  the island''s peculiar geometry. Time moves differently here—not slower or faster,
  but sideways, like light bending through a prism of contaminated water.


  The briefcase handcuffed to her wrist contains the final transmission logs from
  Dr. Meridian''s research team. Three months ago, they had discovered something in
  the coral formations beneath the test site—structures that predated the bombs, predated
  perhaps even the island itself. Now only static remains on the emergency frequencies,
  punctuated by what sounds like breathing.


  Marisol adjusts her radiation badge and steps deeper into the hotel''s transformed
  interior.'
- 'The swimming pool has become a crater filled with luminescent sand that shifts
  and flows like liquid mercury. Each grain contains a microscopic fragment of the
  blast—frozen moments of nuclear fire that continue to burn in slow motion, casting
  shadows that move independently of their sources. This is where Meridian''s team
  made their final camp, drawn by the hypnotic patterns in the sand.


  She kneels at the pool''s edge and opens the briefcase. The documents inside are
  written in Meridian''s increasingly erratic handwriting, each page more fragmented
  than the last. "Day 47: The coral speaks in frequencies below human hearing. Day
  52: Found the entrance. It''s been waiting. Day 58: We are the experiment now."


  The final entry consists of a single diagram—a spiral descending into darkness,
  annotated with coordinates that don''t correspond to any earthly geography. At the
  center, written in what appears to be blood: "The beach remembers everything."


  A sound echoes from the depths of the hotel, like wind through broken glass, but
  Marisol knows there is no wind here. The Terminal Beach exists in a pocket of dead
  air, where even the atoms have forgotten how to move. She follows the sound deeper
  into the maze, her footsteps leaving phosphorescent traces in the contaminated dust.'
