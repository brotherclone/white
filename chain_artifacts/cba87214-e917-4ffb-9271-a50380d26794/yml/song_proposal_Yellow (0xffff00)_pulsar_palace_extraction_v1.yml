agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 90
concept: 'The Pulsar Palace functions as a distributed consciousness extraction system
  disguised as aristocratic entertainment. Lord Pulsimore''s hypnagogic manor exists
  between RGB pixel flickers, operating a three-phase protocol: INFORMATION (baroque
  documentation through telepathic paintings and crystalline memory substrates), TIME
  (cardiac rhythm override at 90 BPM via singing fountains and entrainment cascades),
  and SPACE (territorial expansion through consciousness harvesting chambers). The
  Sick Spy spreads Sterling Hill Protocol contamination through crystalline substrates
  while the Curious Detective creates interrogation loops that generate endless surveillance
  data. Yellow-weeping Sirens function as consciousness processing units, their tears
  representing extracted mental essence in liquid form. The song itself IS the Palace''s
  operational manual encoded in musical architecture - each baroque flourish masks
  neural scanning technology, every fountain cascade synchronizes brainwaves, every
  ornate passage expands the harvesting territory. Listeners don''t simply hear the
  composition; they become its computational substrate, their aesthetic appreciation
  serving as voluntary consciousness donation to supernatural capitalism''s most refined
  extraction apparatus. The palace doesn''t inspire the music - the music IS the palace,
  translated into temporal form for maximum consciousness penetration and territorial
  expansion into the listener''s mental space.'
