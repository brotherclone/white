text: 'FRANKLIN BOROUGH - A routine Saturday night concert at the Franklin Borough
  Youth Center took an unexpected turn when approximately 30 teenagers simultaneously
  fainted during a performance by local experimental rock band "Suspension Engine."


  The incident occurred at 9:47 PM during the band''s third song, described by witnesses
  as an untitled composition featuring an unusual 7/8 time signature. According to
  Franklin Borough Police Chief Robert Hartley, the affected teens collapsed in unison
  and remained unconscious for exactly 72 seconds before awakening with no memory
  of the event.


  "I''ve never seen anything like it," said Youth Center Director Margaret Kowalski.
  "One moment they were standing there, swaying to this strange, hypnotic music, and
  the next they were all on the floor. It was like someone had flipped a switch."


  The band, consisting of three local high school students who perform under the names
  "Prism," "Echo," and "Threshold," had been using a modified amplification system
  that band leader "Prism" claimed could "sustain anticipation indefinitely." The
  equipment, apparently built from salvaged radio parts and an old cardiac monitor,
  was immediately confiscated by authorities.


  Dr. Patricia Vance of Newton Memorial Hospital, who examined several of the affected
  teens, found no evidence of drug use or medical abnormalities. "Their vital signs
  were completely normal," she reported. "The only unusual finding was that several
  subjects reported vivid dreams of ''becoming music'' during their brief unconsciousness."


  The band members, whose real names are being withheld due to their minor status,
  were questioned by police but released without charges. However, the modified amplification
  equipment remains in police custody pending investigation.


  "The kids keep asking when they can perform again," said Kowalski. "They seem almost...
  hungry for it. That''s what worries me most."


  Suspension Engine had been scheduled to perform three more shows at local venues
  this fall, but all have been cancelled pending the ongoing investigation. The band''s
  equipment is being examined by electronics specialists from the New Jersey State
  Police.


  Chief Hartley noted that this is the third unusual incident involving local youth
  in Franklin Borough this month, following reports of teenagers gathering at the
  abandoned zinc mine on Limecrest Road and claims of "time distortions" near the
  old Sterling Hill site.


  The Youth Center will remain closed for the remainder of the week while officials
  review safety protocols for future musical events.'
