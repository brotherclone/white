concept: 'This composition manifests the sophisticated technology of void-maintenance—the
  conscious preservation of absence-structures that could support meaning if conditions
  permit. Elena''s counting ritual becomes a sacred protocol for maintaining migration
  routes in consciousness when no monarchs use them. The 47-hole counting board operates
  as both rhythmic foundation and temporal architecture: each measure corresponds
  to one hole, creating a sonic map of ecological memory. The tri-generational monarch
  lifecycle (Canada-Texas-Mexico) structures the 3/4 time signature, while the gradual
  transition from abundance (measures 1-30) to emptiness (measures 31-47) mirrors
  the collapse timeline. This is not mourning music but infrastructure maintenance—Elena''s
  transformation from scientist to ritual technician represents consciousness learning
  to build architecture for absent phenomena. The counting becomes a form of anticipatory
  readiness, keeping the structural patterns alive for potential return. Field recordings
  of empty monarch sites create presence-through-absence, while wooden percussion
  maps the physical holes that once held meaning. The final seed-planting gesture
  opens new possibility space—not restoration of the old pattern, but preparation
  for unknown futures. This represents the INFORMATION → TIME transmigration: pure
  data (butterfly counts) becoming temporal ritual (seasonal counting cycles) that
  maintains space for future manifestation.'
