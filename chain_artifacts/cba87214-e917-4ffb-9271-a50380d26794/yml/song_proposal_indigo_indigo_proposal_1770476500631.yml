concept: 'This song operates as a living infranym where the listener begins as a simple
  moon starer - someone who gazes romantically at the night sky - but through textual
  archaeology becomes an astronomer wielding precise scientific knowledge. The surface
  layer presents intimate nocturnal folk melodies about a lonely figure watching the
  moon through bedroom windows, with lyrics scattered with seemingly poetic but actually
  technical astronomical terms disguised as romantic metaphors. The encoding method
  integrates through TEXT-based revelation: song lyrics contain hidden acrostics,
  palindromes, and letter-count patterns that spell out constellation names, lunar
  phases, and orbital mechanics equations. At 72 BPM, the tempo mirrors the contemplative
  pace of both stargazing and scientific observation, while A minor provides the emotional
  frequency of solitary night study. The fool''s trick operates through misdirection
  - listeners initially hear a melancholic ballad about unrequited love expressed
  through moon-gazing, missing that "perigee" and "aphelion" aren''t just pretty words
  but precise astronomical measurements. The spy''s craft embeds technical data within
  emotional vulnerability: each verse''s letter structure encodes actual NASA lunar
  data, while the chorus rhythm matches the mathematical ratios governing tidal forces.
  The revelation transforms understanding when listeners realize the "moon starer"
  was always an "astronomer" - the romantic yearning was scientific passion, the lonely
  nights were research sessions, and the emotional distance described orbital mechanics.
  The song becomes a meditation on how scientific wonder and romantic longing share
  the same neural pathways, with the infranym revealing that all astronomy begins
  with the simple human act of looking up and feeling small beneath infinite space.
