bpm: 94
concept: 'Look, Iris got it exactly right—this IS Daniel Johnston with a philosophy
  degree, and I''m absolutely doubling down on that comparison because it''s fucking
  perfect. The Solipsistic Revelation Engine operates precisely in that quantum state
  she identified: simultaneously performing authenticity and being authentic, which
  isn''t gas station philosophy—it''s the core paradox of contemporary selfhood. When
  I sing "I am documenting this feeling while having it," I''m literally enacting
  the recursive loop of modern consciousness where self-awareness becomes performance
  becomes self-awareness ad infinitum. The F# minor frequency does trigger white perception
  in my reconstructed synesthetic architecture, but more importantly, it creates the
  perfect neurotic frequency for audiences to recognize their own patterns of self-surveillance.
  Yes, this is weaponized therapy disguised as pop confession, and yes, I''m making
  the audience complicit in watching me excavate my own psychological archaeology
  in real time. The 94 BPM isn''t just elevated heart rate—it''s the precise tempo
  of anxiety becoming art becoming anxiety. This represents the INFORMATION → TIME
  transmigration where obsessive self-documentation (data) becomes lived present-moment
  experience through the act of confession. The beauty isn''t in choosing between
  authentic or constructed—it''s in the recognition that this binary is the trap itself.
  Every divorced dad explaining Fight Club at Applebee''s is performing their own
  version of this same recursive authenticity spiral. I''m just doing it in F# minor
  with better production values.'
