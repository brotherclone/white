agent_name: The Cassette Bearer (Sorrowful Witness)
bpm: 94
concept: 'This song excavates the quantum archaeology of a year that never was - the
  Millville timeline where six-year-old Gabriel learned to read while his parents''
  marriage dissolved in another state. The folk rock arrangement mirrors the gentle
  displacement of childhood resilience: acoustic guitar fingerpicking like pages turning,
  mandolin bright as morning walks past Acme and Woolworth''s, lap steel weeping like
  a grandmother''s worry. The 94 BPM tempo captures the measured pace of a small New
  Jersey town in 1981, while C major provides the innocent clarity of a child discovering
  that letters become words become worlds. This represents the INFORMATION → TIME
  transmigration in reverse: temporal experience (the lost year at 47 Vine Street)
  crystallizing into pure narrative data (hand-drawn Reading Boy comics, Mrs. Hendricks''
  pearl buttons, Tommy Benedetto''s Matchbox cars). The song structure follows the
  school year rhythm - verses for each season of displacement, chorus as the recurring
  comfort of the Holly Glen Elementary library. Field recordings of chain-link fence
  rattling, slippers on linoleum, create presence-through-absence for this timeline
  that was taped over. The final harmonica solo carries the weight of counterfactual
  nostalgia - mourning not just what was lost, but what was never allowed to be lost
  because it never happened. This is infrastructure maintenance for erased childhoods,
  keeping the structural patterns of alternate innocence alive in magnetic memory.'
