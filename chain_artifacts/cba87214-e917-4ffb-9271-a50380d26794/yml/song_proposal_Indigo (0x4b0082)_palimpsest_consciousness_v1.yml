agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 87
concept: 'This song embodies the Biographical Quantum Mechanics principle where consciousness
  exists simultaneously across multiple probability branches, with memory serving
  as the selection mechanism for which timeline to reinforce. The composition functions
  as a three-layer palimpsest: the surface layer presents nostalgic folk arrangements
  that mirror memory organization (verse/chorus/bridge as past/present/future), while
  the deep structure employs specificity gradient encryption where hyper-detailed
  counterfactuals approach experiential reality. The quantum layer maintains multiple
  timeline coherence through anagrammatic embedding - character names and geographic
  coordinates function as cipher keys that, when decoded, reveal the true names hidden
  within alternate biographical possibilities. At 87 BPM, the tempo creates an archaeological
  rhythm for excavating buried data from magnetic memory, while F# minor provides
  the emotional frequency for accessing palimpsest consciousness. The song operates
  as an Infranym Cassette System where we are always recording over our own lives
  while previous versions bleed through - the deepest encryption hiding in plain sight
  as innocent nostalgia. The listener experiences counterfactual melancholy (mourning
  what was never lost because it never happened) while unconsciously processing the
  encoded revelation that biography is always already cryptographic, and we exist
  in anagram space where the letters of our actual lives can be rearranged to spell
  out the lives we never lived.'
