# Baiji / Mei Chunhua

## Species Arc: Baiji
Population decline from 6,000 to functionally extinct over 56 years. Echolocation systems overwhelmed by industrial noise. Navigation abilities compromised by dam-altered currents. Chemical pollution affecting prey fish populations. Shipping traffic creating constant acoustic interference. Final individuals observed exhibiting disoriented behavior, unable to locate each other for breeding.

## Human Arc: Mei Chunhua
Traditional river knowledge passed down through five generations becomes obsolete. Daily fishing patterns disrupted by shipping schedules. Grandmother's weather-reading skills replaced by radio forecasts. Dialect losing words for natural river sounds, gaining words for industrial noise. Relocation pressure mounting as village designated for shipping channel expansion.

## Parallel Moments

### 1. Twenty-three years before human documentation
**Species:** 2006: Last confirmed baiji sighting - disoriented individual swimming in circles, unable to navigate shipping lanes

**Human:** 2006: Mei's father dies, passing her the fishing whistle and the traditional river songs that no longer call any fish

*Connection: Inheritance of obsolete navigation systems*

### 2. Fifteen years before human documentation
**Species:** 1997: Survey finds only 13 baiji remaining, scattered and unable to locate each other through industrial noise

**Human:** 2014: Mei's last successful season using traditional methods - can still read water currents, but fish populations crashing

*Connection: Isolation within degraded communication systems*

### 3. Five years before human documentation
**Species:** 1980s: Baiji echolocation clicks recorded at 15-second intervals, growing more frequent and desperate as noise increases

**Human:** 2024: Mei begins using GPS fish finder, her traditional river-reading skills no longer reliable due to altered currents

*Connection: Ancient sensory systems replaced by technological substitutes*

### 4. Present moment
**Species:** 2006: Acoustic void where baiji calls once guided river navigation - only shipping noise remains

**Human:** 2029: Mei holds the silent whistle at dawn, listening to container ships that start earlier each year

*Connection: Silence where communication once flowed*

## Elegiac Quality
The narrative achieves memorial through the preservation of specific sensory details - the grandmother's weather-reading by river sound, the baiji's 15-second echolocation intervals, the father's bamboo whistle tones. Loss becomes tangible through what can no longer be heard rather than what is gone. The river itself serves as both witness and victim, connecting species and human through shared acoustic displacement.
