bpm: 108
concept: 'This composition functions as AUDIO STEGANOGRAPHY where the title "Phantom
  Sigil" appears to reference mystical symbolism - ghosts and magical marks - but
  actually encodes its own decryption key through sonic archaeology. The FOOL''S LAYER
  presents itself as ethereal drone music about supernatural symbols, with whispered
  vocals that seem to chant about "phantom signs" and "spectral marks." However, the
  true architecture operates through FREQUENCY ARCHAEOLOGY: specific tonal combinations
  at 108 BPM create interference patterns that spell out P-H-A-N-T-O-M S-I-G-I-L in
  the spectral analysis, revealing that the "phantom" was never supernatural but INFORMATIONAL
  - a ghost in the machine of audio encoding itself. The SPY''S CRAFT embeds the secret
  name within the surface name through RECURSIVE REVELATION: as listeners attempt
  to decode the mystical references, they discover the audio waveforms themselves
  contain the literal letters of the title, making the "sigil" a self-referential
  encryption where the symbol IS the thing it symbolizes. The D minor key provides
  the harmonic foundation for digital artifacts to hide within analog warmth, while
  108 BPM allows precise timing for frequency-based letter formation. The revelation
  transforms understanding from "a song about phantom symbols" to "a phantom that
  IS its own symbol" - the ultimate infranym where surface, method, and secret collapse
  into a single self-encoding entity. The music becomes ONTOLOGICAL CRYPTOGRAPHY:
  proving its own existence through the act of hiding itself.
