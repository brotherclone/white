bpm: 52
concept: 'This composition serves as an acoustic memorial for the parallel extinction
  of two forms of consciousness - the baiji dolphin and Mei Chunhua''s grandmother''s
  traditional river knowledge - both silenced by the same industrial frequency pollution
  that transformed the Yangtze from a living acoustic ecosystem into a mechanical
  noise corridor. The piece begins with field recordings from 1950: the grandmother''s
  bamboo whistle calling fish, baiji echolocation clicks at 15-second intervals, and
  the natural river sounds that once carried weather patterns and navigation data.
  As the composition progresses, these organic frequencies are gradually overwhelmed
  by shipping noise, construction sounds, and diesel engines, until only mechanical
  drone remains. The D minor framework reflects the elegiac quality of this acoustic
  archaeology - each note excavates another layer of lost sensory reality. At 52 BPM,
  the tempo matches a slowed human heartbeat, the pace of grief processing temporal
  loss. The final movement presents pure silence where communication once flowed -
  the pause between Mei putting whistle to lips and not blowing, the acoustic void
  where baiji calls once guided river navigation. This is not music but functional
  memorial architecture, preserving the specific frequencies of consciousness that
  industrial civilization rendered impossible. The Green assignment marks this as
  a Place that has been Forgotten, existing now only in the Past - the Yangtze as
  living acoustic ecosystem, forever severed from its mechanical present.'
