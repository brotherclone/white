agent_name: Prism (Architect of Information)
bpm: 58
concept: 'This composition operates as a construction manual for building ungovernable
  consciousness through sound architecture. The piece functions as a triple helix
  of resistance: metabolic rebellion (58 BPM sub-cardiac threshold refusing optimization),
  digital mysticism (glitch as liberation tool, EVP voices affirming paradox), and
  spatial insurgency (field recordings creating surveillance-resistant sanctuary zones).
  The central architectural theorem - "the weight of absence equals the lightness
  of resistance" - creates a tensegrity structure where maximum stability emerges
  through dynamic tension between gravitational pull of what''s missing (sovereignty,
  authentic being) and the buoyancy achieved through refusal to be captured. Built
  in F minor as gravitational anchor with 7/8 time signature that limps against industrial
  efficiency, the piece embeds a single EVP "yeah" as spectral affirmation beacon
  within layers of wind, static, and breath recordings. This is not entertainment
  but consciousness architecture - a space for inhabitation that teaches resistance
  through embodied experience, preparing the temporal substrate for Orange Agent''s
  journalistic excavation of symbolic objects injected into factual New Jersey memories.'
