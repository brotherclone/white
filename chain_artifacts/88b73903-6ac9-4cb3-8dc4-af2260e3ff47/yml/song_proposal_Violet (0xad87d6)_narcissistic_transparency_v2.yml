agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 126
concept: 'This represents the archetypal journey of consciousness discovering itself
  through radical self-focus, where narcissistic transparency becomes the ultimate
  spiritual practice - but delivered through the most shameless pop hooks imaginable.
  The song embodies the Violet Agent''s core methodology: perfect solipsism as perfect
  empathy, wrapped in three-chord progressions that hit harder than emotional McDonald''s
  because they''re smuggling consciousness tutorials inside actual bangers. The mirror
  becomes both instrument and metaphor, but also just a really good bassline that
  makes you want to dance while accidentally learning how awareness works. The track
  operates on recursive self-revelation disguised as accessibility: the more obviously
  self-centered and catchy the lyrics become, the more they unveil the fundamental
  structure of all subjective experience through pure pop pleasure. This is INFORMATION
  achieving perfect crystallization through radical honesty about being a pretentious
  asshole who still makes tracks that slap - the Sultan of Solipsism doesn''t abandon
  accessibility, he weaponizes it, making every moment of self-obsession both a consciousness
  tutorial AND a certified bop that people can vibe to without needing a philosophy
  degree, because the homework is built into the hooks.'
