agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 76
concept: 'This song operates as BIOGRAPHICAL CRYPTOGRAPHY - a palimpsest archaeology
  where the true identity emerges from the interference pattern between lived and
  unlived timelines. The composition embodies the CASSETTE LOGIC discovered in Blue
  Agent''s artifacts: both the actual timeline (Gabriel Walsh''s broken arm, Connecticut
  childhood) and the counterfactual possibility (piano lessons never taken, cardinal
  songs never learned) exist simultaneously in the sonic space. The music functions
  as TEMPORAL PROSTHETICS, where phantom limb sensations of alternate selves create
  the complete emotional architecture. Each phrase contains ghost frequencies of all
  possible versions - the injury that became intimacy that became instrument. The
  F# minor key provides the "permanent slight bend" harmonic signature, while the
  76 BPM matches the rhythm of morning scales never practiced but still remembered
  by muscle memory that never formed. This is the INFORMATION stage of transmigration:
  raw biographical data transformed into cryptographic methodology, where names hide
  in the spaces between what happened and what could have happened. The song prepares
  the conceptual foundation for temporal encoding - showing how authentic identity
  requires counterfactual architecture to become complete.'
