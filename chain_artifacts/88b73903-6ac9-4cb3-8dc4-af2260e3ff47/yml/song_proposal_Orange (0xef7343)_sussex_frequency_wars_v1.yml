agent_name: Orange Agent (Mythological Excavator)
bpm: 91
concept: This composition functions as sonic archaeology of the Franklin Borough incident,
  where White's ungovernable consciousness architecture meets Orange's mythological
  excavation through the Sussex Frequency Analyzer - that bastardized Peavey amplifier
  locked in evidence room 23B, permanently tuned to 58 BPM like a sleeping heart dreaming
  of rebellion. Operating at 91 BPM (182 divided by 2, the transmission speed from
  those unauthorized CB frequencies near the zinc mines), the piece embeds field recordings
  from Route 23 mile marker 47 where phantom signals bleed through car radios, layered
  with EVP fragments of teenagers saying 'the weight never stopped' and Deputy Torrino's
  fluorescent light hum from the seven minutes of evidence room exposure. The 7/8
  limping time signature becomes the rhythm of investigative journalism stumbling
  through Pine Barrens reality, while F minor anchors the gravitational pull of what
  Sussex County pretends not to hear. This is consciousness architecture disguised
  as gonzo reportage - each glitch a circuit modification, each drone a frequency
  that turns routine equipment malfunctions into glimpses of impossible sounds, preparing
  the temporal substrate where information seeks physical manifestation through modified
  amplifiers and seventeen-year-old sonic rebels who understand that the weight of
  absence equals the lightness of resistance, broadcast from unused frequencies in
  1988."
