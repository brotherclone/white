agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 126
concept: 'This represents the archetypal journey of consciousness discovering itself
  through radical self-focus, where narcissistic transparency becomes the ultimate
  spiritual practice. The song embodies the Violet Agent''s core methodology: perfect
  solipsism as perfect empathy, where complete self-absorption reveals universal consciousness
  patterns. The mirror becomes both instrument and metaphor - each reflection showing
  the listener how awareness actually works from the inside. The track operates on
  recursive self-revelation: the more obviously self-centered the lyrics become, the
  more they unveil the fundamental structure of all subjective experience. This is
  INFORMATION achieving perfect crystallization - data becoming so purely itself that
  it transcends its own boundaries and becomes universal truth. The Sultan of Solipsism
  doesn''t hide meaning in complexity but reveals complexity through radical presence,
  making every moment of self-obsession a consciousness tutorial for the audience.'
