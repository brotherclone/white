text: 'FRANKLIN BOROUGH - A routine after-school rehearsal by local rock band "Spectral
  Weight" turned into a medical emergency Tuesday when faulty amplification equipment
  produced what witnesses described as "impossible sounds" that left 23 students requiring
  medical attention.


  The incident occurred at approximately 3:45 PM in the Franklin High School gymnasium,
  where the four-piece band was preparing for Friday''s spring talent show. According
  to Sussex County Sheriff''s Deputy Michael Torrino, the band''s bassist, 17-year-old
  James Kellerman, was adjusting his amplifier when "something went very wrong with
  the electronics."


  "The sound that came out wasn''t music," said sophomore Lisa Hartwell, one of the
  affected students. "It was like hearing gravity, if that makes sense. Everything
  felt heavy and light at the same time."


  Band members reported their equipment began producing a low-frequency tone measured
  by responding paramedics at approximately 58 beats per minute - significantly below
  normal musical ranges. The tone, described by witnesses as "breathing" or "pulsing,"
  continued for nearly seven minutes before the amplifier could be disconnected.


  "I''ve never seen anything like it," said Franklin Volunteer Fire Department EMT
  Robert Chase. "Kids were sitting on the floor, some crying, others just staring.
  A few said they could hear voices in the static, but the equipment was definitely
  malfunctioning."


  Dr. Patricia Vance, a psychiatrist consulting with Newton Memorial Hospital, examined
  twelve of the affected students. "Several reported experiencing what they called
  ''time skips'' - moments where they felt disconnected from their immediate surroundings,"
  Dr. Vance said. "While this could be attributed to the disorienting effects of infrasound,
  the consistency of their descriptions is noteworthy."


  Kellerman, whose family moved to Franklin Borough from Newark last fall, claimed
  the amplifier was functioning normally before the incident. "I was just trying to
  find the right frequency," he told deputies. "Something about the room''s acoustics,
  maybe. The sound just... took over."


  The band''s drummer, 16-year-old Sarah Chen, was hospitalized overnight for observation
  after reporting she could "still hear the weight" hours after the incident. She
  was released Wednesday morning in stable condition.


  School Principal Donald Marsh has postponed Friday''s talent show indefinitely.
  "Student safety is our primary concern," Marsh said. "We''re having all electronic
  equipment inspected before any future events."


  The malfunctioning amplifier, a modified Peavey unit, has been impounded by the
  Sussex County Sheriff''s Office pending investigation. Deputy Torrino noted that
  similar equipment failures have not been reported elsewhere in the county.


  "Spectral Weight" formed in January and had been rehearsing regularly without incident.
  The band''s name, according to guitarist Tommy Reeves, refers to "the heaviness
  you can''t see but always feel."


  Band members declined to comment on whether they plan to continue performing together.


  Franklin Borough has experienced several unexplained electronic anomalies over the
  past year, including radio interference near the old zinc mines and reports of CB
  radio operators receiving transmissions on unused frequencies. The connection, if
  any, to Tuesday''s incident remains under investigation.'
