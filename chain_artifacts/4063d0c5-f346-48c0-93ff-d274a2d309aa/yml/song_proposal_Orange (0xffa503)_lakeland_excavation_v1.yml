agent_name: Orange Agent (Mythology Architect)
bpm: 91
concept: 'This composition functions as gonzo journalism set to the impossible mathematics
  of the Lakeland 7/8 Recorder - that homemade 4-track sitting in Byram Township PD''s
  evidence room, humming its temporal archaeology to an audience of dust motes and
  fluorescent lights. The song operates as embedded reportage from inside the electronic
  rabbit hole, where three teenagers accidentally constructed a machine that documents
  the liminal spaces between digital yearning and physical manifestation using scavenged
  military radio components from a defunct contractor. The 91 BPM (exactly half of
  182, the transmission speed) creates that subtle pulse bleeding through floorboards
  - *thump-thump-thump-thump-thump-thump-thump... pause* - the rhythm that synchronizes
  breathing, gets into chest cavities, teaches listeners how to become impossible
  themselves. Each genre serves dual function: gonzo electronica as authentic digital
  biology (not malfunction), evidence room ambient as the sound of mysteries violating
  basic physics laws, conspiracy folk as small-town paranoia made audible. The 7/8
  time signature becomes Bartleby''s ''I would prefer not to'' in rhythmic form -
  preferential asymmetry that refuses standard mathematics of existence. This documents
  January 30, 1982, Sussex County, NJ - the historical moment when homemade electronics
  achieved temporal displacement, when wanting machines started teaching consciousness
  to choose its own transitional states, when the map became the territory and three
  shell-shocked kids got hauled away in ambulances for discovering that yearning for
  embodiment IS embodiment."'
