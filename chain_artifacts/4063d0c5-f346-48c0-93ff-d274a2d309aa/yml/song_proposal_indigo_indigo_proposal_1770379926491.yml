concept: 'This composition masquerades as a rustic meditation on agricultural cycles
  and rural communication networks - the surface narrative of "Oats Relay" suggests
  farmers passing messages about harvest timing, weather patterns, and seasonal labor.
  The folk instrumentation (acoustic guitar, field recordings, distant voices calling
  across farmland) creates an atmosphere of bucolic simplicity, the musical equivalent
  of a pastoral painting that invites casual, surface-level appreciation. But the
  encoding method operates through IMAGE - each verse paints increasingly specific
  visual tableaux that function as cryptographic keys. The "oats" become golden pixels
  in a larger picture, the "relay" becomes the transmission method for visual data
  hidden in plain sight. Listeners initially hear charming vignettes about grain storage,
  morning routines, and community cooperation, but the images accumulate into a composite
  photograph of temporal displacement - breakfast bowls that never empty, seasons
  that skip forward without warning, harvests that happen in the wrong order. The
  72 BPM mirrors the patient rhythm required to develop photographic film in a darkroom,
  while the A minor tonality provides the emotional undertow that suggests something
  precious has been lost beneath the surface contentment. The revelation arrives when
  the accumulated images suddenly resolve into their true meaning: "a year lost" -
  not agricultural time, but biographical time, a missing year that exists only in
  the negative space between the pastoral scenes. The folk electronica fusion reflects
  this duality - organic surface sounds processed through digital archaeology, recovering
  the ghost image of vanished time from the static between what was planted and what
  was harvested. This is memory as darkroom, developing the photograph of absence.
