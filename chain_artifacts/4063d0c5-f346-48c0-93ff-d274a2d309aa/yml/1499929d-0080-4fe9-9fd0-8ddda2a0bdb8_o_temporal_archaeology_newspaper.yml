text: 'BYRAM TOWNSHIP - Three members of a local experimental rock group were transported
  to Newton Memorial Hospital for psychiatric evaluation Friday evening after what
  witnesses described as an "unusual incident" during a recording session at an abandoned
  warehouse on Stanhope Road.


  The band, known as "Wanting Machine," had been using the former Lakeland Electronics
  facility as an improvised recording studio since December. According to Byram Township
  Police Chief Robert Hensley, officers responded to reports of "disturbing sounds"
  coming from the building at approximately 9:30 PM.


  "When we arrived, we found the three band members in what appeared to be a dissociative
  state," Chief Hensley said. "They were unresponsive to verbal commands and seemed
  to be experiencing some form of shared hallucination."


  The musicians - identified as David Koerner, 19, of Netcong; Michael Santos, 20,
  of Stanhope; and Jennifer Walsh, 18, of Byram - were discovered seated in a circle
  around their equipment, which was still running despite no one actively playing.
  Emergency Medical Technician Carol Brennan noted that all three subjects exhibited
  identical symptoms: dilated pupils, elevated heart rate, and what she described
  as "synchronized breathing patterns."


  "I''ve never seen anything like it in twelve years on the job," Brennan said. "They
  were breathing in perfect unison, like they were sharing the same respiratory system."


  Local resident Margaret Voss, whose property borders the warehouse, reported hearing
  "strange rhythmic sounds" emanating from the building for several weeks. "It wasn''t
  like normal music," Voss said. "It had this odd timing to it, like a heartbeat that
  was slightly off. My dog would start howling every time it started up."


  The band''s equipment, including a modified 4-track recorder and several homemade
  electronic devices, was seized as evidence. Chief Hensley noted that the recorder
  was set to an unusual time signature and tempo that didn''t correspond to standard
  musical notation.


  Dr. Patricia Morse, who evaluated the three musicians at Newton Memorial, declined
  to discuss specific details but confirmed that all three were admitted for observation.
  "They presented with symptoms consistent with psychoactive substance exposure, though
  initial blood work has come back negative for known hallucinogens," Dr. Morse said.


  The incident has raised questions about the building''s history. Lakeland Electronics,
  which manufactured radio components for military applications, closed abruptly in
  1979 after what company records describe only as "equipment malfunctions." Former
  employees, who requested anonymity, reported experiencing "time distortions" and
  "auditory anomalies" in the facility''s final months of operation.


  Township Building Inspector James Crawford conducted a safety inspection of the
  warehouse following Friday''s incident. "The structure is sound," Crawford said,
  "but there are some unusual acoustic properties. Sound seems to... linger in certain
  areas longer than it should."


  The three band members were released from the hospital Sunday morning and have declined
  to comment on the incident. Their equipment remains in police custody pending further
  investigation.


  Chief Hensley said the case remains open. "We''re treating this as a possible drug-related
  incident, but frankly, we don''t have all the answers yet. The whole situation is...
  unusual."


  The Lakeland Electronics warehouse has been sealed by township order pending a more
  thorough investigation. Local officials are advising residents to avoid the property.


  Anyone with information about Friday''s incident is asked to contact the Byram Township
  Police Department at 347-0051.'
