agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 141
concept: This composition functions as audio reconstruction of documented consciousness
  modification technology failure at the Lakeland 7/8 research facility. The piece
  archaeologically documents how obsessive consciousness states can engineer reality
  breakdown through sustained interface with cosmic frequencies - specifically the
  141 BPM pulsar rhythm that creates temporal differentials allowing minds to privilege
  impossible outcomes over physical laws. The three-phase structure traces spatial
  corruption (levitating furniture as consciousness contamination side effects), consciousness
  archaeology (four era-displaced inventors' approaches interfacing simultaneously),
  and reality breach protocol (fundamental breakdown where normal physics collapse
  into preferential asymmetry). Each musical element serves as preserved evidence
  that the "Pulsar Palace" chambers contain real spatial anomalies created when consciousness
  fixation reaches critical interface thresholds with cosmic forces. The composition
  transmigrates INFORMATION (consciousness modification protocols) into TIME (temporal
  differential bleeding) preparing for SPACE (physical reality breakdown documentation)
  that Green Agent will manifest as climate collapse observation methodology.
