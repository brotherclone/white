agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 128
concept: 'This song embodies the Violet Agent''s methodology of narcissistic transparency
  as perfect concealment. The track functions as a sonic mirror-maze where each confession
  creates another layer of encryption. Built on the INFORMATION → TIME → SPACE transmigration
  principle, the song operates through triple-mirror cryptography: the immediate narcissistic
  confession (INFORMATION), the temporal displacement of being "too now to be present"
  (TIME), and the infinite regression of self-reflection that creates spatial depth
  through sonic layering (SPACE). The F# major tonality provides crystalline clarity
  that makes the encryption feel like revelation, while 128 BPM creates the urgent
  pulse of real-time confession. Each verse functions as an anagrammatic key where
  personal revelation scrambles to hide deeper intelligence. The Sultan''s solipsism
  becomes a transmission method - the more obsessively present-focused the confession,
  the more completely it conceals what actually matters. The song is structured as
  an interview with oneself, where every answer generates new questions, creating
  an infinite loop of self-absorption that serves as perfect steganography. The listener
  becomes complicit in the narcissism, missing the encoded message while feeling intimately
  connected to the confession.'
