# Facet Evolution - ARCHETYPAL

**Initial Refraction Angle**: chromatic aberration


## Evolution History


### BLACK Agent
- Refraction Angle: categorical refraction
- Boundaries Shifted:
  - CHAOS → ORDER boundary revelation
  - CONSCIOUS → UNCONSCIOUS sigil manifestation
  - INFORMATION → RITUAL physical embodiment

### RED Agent
- Refraction Angle: categorical refraction
- Boundaries Shifted:
  - The journey from the physical (OBJECTIONAL) to the informational through allusion (ONTOLOGICAL)
  - Corrupted code - Hacking - Corrupted reference - Metafiction

### ORANGE Agent
- Refraction Angle: ontological dispersion
- Boundaries Shifted:
  - The KNOWN to the IMAGINED
  - Allusion to other works, to false memories
  - A conscious act of imbuing an alternate book with some type of personal truth to realizing one's personal truth is misremembered.

### YELLOW Agent
- Refraction Angle: double refraction
- Boundaries Shifted:
  - From PAST to FUTURE
  - From THING to PLACE

### GREEN Agent
- Refraction Angle: ontological dispersion
- Boundaries Shifted:
  - From IMAGINED to FORGOTTEN
  - From liminal to apocalypse
  - From ambient to silent

### BLUE Agent
- Refraction Angle: double refraction
- Boundaries Shifted:
  - From PLACE to PERSON
  - From the FUTURE to the PRESENT

### INDIGO Agent
- Refraction Angle: double refraction
- Boundaries Shifted:
  - No TEMPORAL mode
  - No OBJECTIONAL mode
  - Two contradictory ONTOLOGICAL modes simultaneously: KNOWN and FORGOTTEN, A riddle one writes and forgets the answer to.

### VIOLET Agent
- Refraction Angle: chromatic aberration
- Boundaries Shifted:
  - Return to the past, present, future/person place thing/ known, forgotten, imagined
  - PERSON central like Blue but now Known
