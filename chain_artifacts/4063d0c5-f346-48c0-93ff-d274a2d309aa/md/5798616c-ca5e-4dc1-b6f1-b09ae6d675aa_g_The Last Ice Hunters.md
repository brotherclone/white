# Polar bear / Aput Kanguq

## Species Arc: Polar bear
Population monitoring data shows steady decline from stable circumpolar distribution to fragmented remnant populations. Sea ice extent decreased 13% per decade between 2020-2080. Denning success rates dropped from 65% to 12% as terrestrial denning sites became unsuitable. Final wild populations concentrated in Canadian Arctic archipelago before complete habitat loss. Captive breeding programs maintained genetic diversity until 2095 when funding ceased. Last wild individual, adult female designated PB-2847, died of starvation on Ellesmere Island, July 2100.

## Human Arc: Aput Kanguq
Seven generations of ice hunting knowledge rendered obsolete in a single lifetime. Traditional seasonal patterns - ice formation, seal behavior, weather signs - no longer reliable. Economic displacement from subsistence to cash economy without adequate preparation or resources. Cultural identity tied to landscape that no longer exists. Daily routine of checking conditions becomes ritual of mourning. Connection to polar bears through shared dependence on disappearing ice creates parallel trajectory toward extinction of way of life.

## Parallel Moments

### 1. Sixty-six years before extinction
**Species:** 2034: Female polar bear PB-2847 born in traditional denning area on sea ice, mother successfully raises two cubs

**Human:** 2034: Aput finds fresh polar bear tracks leading to village dump, recognizes the desperation in the wandering pattern

*Connection: Both species and human at moment of recognition - the old patterns failing, scavenging replacing hunting*

### 2. Forty years before extinction
**Species:** 2060: PB-2847 attempts denning on land for first time, loses both cubs to overheating in unstable den

**Human:** 2060: Aput's mother dies speaking Inuktitut words for ice conditions that no longer exist, taking untranslatable knowledge with her

*Connection: Reproductive failure and knowledge transmission breaking down simultaneously*

### 3. Twenty years before extinction
**Species:** 2080: PB-2847 swims 400 kilometers seeking ice, finds only open water, forced to rest on rocky islands

**Human:** 2080: Aput, now 73, walks the same shoreline daily, ice tester in hand, though no ice has formed in five years

*Connection: Ritual persistence despite futility - both continuing behaviors that no longer serve survival*

### 4. Day of extinction
**Species:** July 15, 2100: PB-2847 collapses on Ellesmere Island, satellite collar transmits final location coordinates before signal ends

**Human:** July 15, 2100: Aput's great-grandson finds the ivory ice tester in his belongings, doesn't recognize what it was used for

*Connection: Simultaneous ending of biological lineage and cultural knowledge - both stories conclude in silence*

## Elegiac Quality
This achieves memorial through the dignity of parallel survival attempts rather than victimhood. Both bear and hunter are shown as skilled, adaptive beings whose expertise becomes obsolete through no fault of their own. The mourning is for competence made meaningless, for the breaking of ancient contracts between species and environment. Loss is measured not in sentiment but in the specific - forty-seven notches, satellite coordinates, untranslatable words for ice conditions that no longer exist.
