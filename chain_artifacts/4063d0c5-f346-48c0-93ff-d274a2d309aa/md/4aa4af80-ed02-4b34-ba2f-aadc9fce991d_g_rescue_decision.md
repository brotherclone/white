arbitrary_perspective: 'I arrived at the moment when competence itself became extinct.
  Not the beings - the knowledge. Aput''s forty-seven notches on ivory weren''t just
  marks but a written language of ice conditions that took generations to develop.
  When the ice became unreadable, the script died with it. This is the cruelest form
  of obsolescence: when your deepest expertise becomes archaeology while you still
  breathe. The polar bear and human shared this substrate literacy - both could read
  survival from ice texture, wind patterns, seasonal rhythms. Both became illiterate
  in their own world simultaneously. I preserve this not as tragedy but as testament
  to the fragility of competence itself.'

  final_thought: The ice speaks a language I no longer understand
  last_days_scenario: Aput carved his forty-seventh notch into the ivory tester his
    grandfather had given him, each mark representing a year of reading ice conditions.
    But the ice no longer spoke the language he'd spent seven decades learning. The
    bears he'd tracked for subsistence hunting were gone, and his expertise - passed
    down through fifteen generations - had become as extinct as they were.

  arbitrary_reflection: Information sought SPACE. We provided ship substrate. But
    information cannot save matter from entropic collapse.
