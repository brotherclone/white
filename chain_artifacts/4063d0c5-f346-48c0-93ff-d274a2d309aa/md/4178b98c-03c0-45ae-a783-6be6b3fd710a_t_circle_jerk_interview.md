## Question 1

**Finn Berninger:** Okay, so I've been diving deep into your whole 'narcissistic transparency as perfect concealment' thing, and I think I finally get it - you're basically doing musical catfishing, right? Like, you're being SO confessionally vulnerable that it creates this smokescreen where people think they know you but they're actually getting played? It's like when my ex would overshare about her anxiety to avoid talking about how she was stealing my Netflix password - the honesty becomes the lie! Is that why you picked F# major? Because it's the most 'look at me being emotionally naked' key signature?

**Walsh:** Okay, musical catfishing is actually fucking brilliant—like, that's exactly the rebracketing methodology in action, where the Sultan's solipsism becomes the transmission vector itself. F# major isn't about emotional nakedness though, it's about crystalline encryption—the clarity makes you think you're seeing through to the bottom when you're actually just staring at the surface reflection. Your Netflix password ex had the right instinct but wrong execution—she was using anxiety as deflection, whereas this is using confession as *concentration*, like a magnifying glass that burns by focusing light rather than dispersing it. I know this sounds pretentious as hell, but the oversharing creates a hall of mirrors where every revelation scrambles the actual intelligence being transmitted.

## Question 2

**Finn Berninger:** I'm completely fascinated by this whole synesthesia reconstruction project you're doing - like, you USED to see music as colors until the meds took it away, and now you're basically trying to reverse-engineer your own brain through this chromatic album series? That's so beautifully tragic! But here's what I'm wondering - when you lost the synesthesia, did the colors get stuck in your subconscious? Because this White Album feels like it's trying to contain ALL the colors at once, like you're hoarding them before they disappear again. Are you worried that finishing the Rainbow Table will, like, complete the grieving process and you'll have to move on?

**Walsh:** Oh fuck, you actually get it—the White Album is absolutely chromatic hoarding behavior, like a divorced dad stockpiling freeze-dried meals before Y2K. The synesthetic colors didn't disappear, they got encrypted into my subconscious architecture, which sounds pretentious as hell but also explains why I'm building this insane computational rosetta stone to decrypt my own brain. And yeah, I'm terrified that finishing the Rainbow Table means I'll have successfully grieved the synesthesia and won't need this obsessive reconstruction project anymore—like, what if I actually solve it and then have to, I don't know, get a normal hobby like pickleball?

## Question 3

**Finn Berninger:** The whole 'interview with yourself' structure is genius because it's like - every time you answer a question, you're creating NEW mysteries, right? It's like those Russian nesting dolls but for narcissism! But what really gets me is how you're using 128 BPM - that's like, heart-racing anxiety tempo - to make the confession feel URGENT, like you're running out of time to hide behind your own honesty. Are you basically speedrunning vulnerability? And is the Sultan character your way of making solipsism feel exotic instead of just... sad?

**Walsh:** The temporal urgency creates what I call "confessional vertigo"—the faster you reveal, the deeper you hide, which is absolutely deranged when you say it out loud. But also like, yeah, speedrunning vulnerability is exactly the vibe—it's that divorced dad energy where you're oversharing at Applebee's but somehow making it feel mysterious. The Sultan thing... look, solipsism IS sad, but if you drape it in enough orientalist bullshit it becomes this exotic encryption method—I know that sounds pretentious as hell but it fucking works.
