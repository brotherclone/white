# Rusty patched bumble bee / Maria Elena Vasquez

## Species Arc: Rusty patched bumble bee
In 2000, Bombus affinis populations thrived across 28 US states and 2 Canadian provinces, their distinctive rusty patch marking them as essential pollinators for wild blueberries, cranberries, and native prairie flowers. By 2010, neonicotinoid pesticide applications had reduced colonies by 87%. The bees' navigation systems, disrupted by chemical exposure, led workers to abandon hives or die in the field. Population surveys in 2020 documented fewer than 1000 individuals. The last confirmed sighting occurred in March 2030 in Watsonville, California - a worker bee found dead beside a strawberry bloom, its body containing lethal concentrations of imidacloprid.

## Human Arc: Maria Elena Vasquez
Maria Elena Vasquez spent twenty-three years walking strawberry fields at dawn, timing pesticide applications to protect the few remaining bees while ensuring crop pollination. Her rust-colored bandana became a familiar sight to growers who relied on her precise coordination between chemical schedules and bee activity. The same neonicotinoids that killed the bees accumulated in her nervous system, causing tremors that made her handwriting illegible and disorientation that mirrored the bees' navigational failure. In March 2041, eleven years after the last bee died in her fields, Maria's hands could no longer hold a clipboard steady enough to record the data that might have saved them both.

## Parallel Moments

### 1. March 2030
**Species:** Last confirmed rusty patched bumble bee found dead beside strawberry bloom in Watsonville, body containing lethal imidacloprid concentrations

**Human:** Maria's handwriting becomes illegible, same month as final bee sighting in her fields

*Connection: Both bee and coordinator lose essential functions - navigation for bee, documentation for Maria - due to identical chemical exposure*

### 2. 2020-2025
**Species:** Remaining bee colonies abandon hives, workers die in fields, population drops below 1000

**Human:** Maria begins losing her way between familiar fields, forgetting which sections were sprayed

*Connection: Neurological damage causes identical disorientation in both species and human*

### 3. 2010-2020
**Species:** 87% population decline as neonicotinoids disrupt bee navigation and colony function

**Human:** Maria develops tremors and memory gaps but continues coordinating spray schedules

*Connection: Both continue essential work even as toxins destroy their capacity to perform it*

### 4. March 2041
**Species:** Eleven years of silence in fields once filled with bee activity

**Human:** Maria's final weeks watching automated spray drones replace both bees and her job

*Connection: Technological replacement eliminates both natural pollinator and human coordinator made obsolete by the same chemicals*

## Elegiac Quality
The narrative achieves memorial through precise documentation of interdependence - how the same chemicals that promised agricultural abundance destroyed both the natural pollinator and the human who tried to bridge that gap. Loss is honored through specificity rather than sentiment: the exact month when handwriting failed, the measured decline in bee populations, the rust-colored thread connecting species across time. Mourning emerges from the careful cataloging of what was essential and is now absent.
