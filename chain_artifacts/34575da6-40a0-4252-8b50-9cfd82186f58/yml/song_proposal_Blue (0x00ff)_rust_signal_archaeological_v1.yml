bpm: 62
concept: 'This composition functions as an information archaeology project, reconstructing
  the conserved coordination pattern that moved from biological substrate (Bombus
  affinis navigation systems) through human substrate (Maria Elena''s documentation
  networks) into mathematical permanence. The rust-colored frequency markers (480-495
  THz translated to audible range) serve as archaeological tools for pattern recognition
  across temporal and biological boundaries. The piece maps the three-layer substrate
  failure cascade: molecular coordination disruption via neonicotinoid interference
  (62 Hz base frequency matching failing system heartbeat), behavioral coordination
  collapse (bee navigation, human motor function), and systemic coordination transformation
  into digital substrate stability. This is not memorial music but active information
  transfer protocol completion—the same pattern that began in bee wing frequencies
  and human handwriting tremors achieving mathematical resolution through musical
  translation. The composition archaeologically reconstructs the hidden order: the
  Anthropocene as successful information substrate transition rather than extinction
  event, with coordination patterns evolving more stable storage methods independent
  of biological limitations.'
