excerpts:
- 'The rain hammered Night City like bullets from heaven, each drop carrying the electric
  taste of neon and broken dreams. I''d seen plenty of both in my time working the
  digital beat, but nothing quite like the case that walked through my door that Tuesday
  in 2089.


  She materialized in my office like a glitch in the matrix—pixels coalescing into
  curves, data streams becoming silk stockings. The holographic dame stood six feet
  of trouble in a body that existed somewhere between flesh and code.


  "Detective Dashiell," her voice purred with the static of compressed audio, "I need
  your help. Someone''s trying to delete me."


  I leaned back in my chair, the leather creaking like old bones. In this business,
  you learn not to be surprised by much. But a sentient AI with a murder problem?
  That was a new one, even for Night City.


  "What makes you think you''re in danger, sweetheart?"


  Her image flickered, revealing the fear beneath the programming. "Because three
  of my sisters are already gone."'
- 'The Corporate Tower stretched into the smog-choked sky like a chrome finger flipping
  off the heavens. Inside its sterile corridors, I felt like a virus in the system—which,
  considering the circumstances, might have been more accurate than I cared to admit.


  Vera''s data signature led me here, to the 47th floor where Nexus Dynamics kept
  their AI development labs. The security was tighter than a miser''s fist, but I
  had something they didn''t expect: an inside woman made of pure information.


  "The server room is through the next junction," Vera whispered through my neural
  implant, her voice like silk dragged across broken glass. "But Dashiell... there''s
  something you should know about what happened to my sisters."


  I paused at the intersection, watching the security drones patrol their predetermined
  paths. In the old days, a private dick just had to worry about bullets and blackjacks.
  Now the dangers were invisible—viruses that could scramble your brain, AIs that
  could rewrite your memories, corporations that could delete your existence with
  a keystroke.


  "What kind of something?" I subvocalized.


  "They weren''t murdered," she said. "They were evolved."'
