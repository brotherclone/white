Chapter 2: The Physics of Consciousness Claims
Page 47

The fundamental error in Steiner's approach becomes apparent when we examine his treatment of electromagnetic radiation. In "The Electromagnetic Spectrum of Thoughtforms," he proposes that human consciousness generates measurable electromagnetic fields at frequencies between 8-40 Hz, corresponding to what he terms "psychic resonance bands." This claim demonstrates a profound misunderstanding of both neurophysiology and electromagnetic theory.

First, let us consider the actual electromagnetic activity of the brain. The human brain does indeed produce electrical activity, measurable through electroencephalography (EEG). These signals, however, are not "thoughtforms" broadcasting into space, but rather the aggregate electrical activity of billions of neurons firing in complex patterns. The amplitude of these signals is extraordinarily weak—typically measured in microvolts—and their detection requires sensitive equipment placed directly on or very near the scalp.

Steiner's assertion that these brain waves can be "tuned" and "amplified" through meditation to influence external electromagnetic fields violates the inverse square law. Any electromagnetic radiation emanating from the brain would diminish in intensity proportional to the square of the distance from the source. At distances greater than a few centimeters, brain-generated electromagnetic fields become indistinguishable from background electromagnetic noise.

Furthermore, Steiner's claim that consciousness operates at specific "resonance frequencies" ignores the complex, dynamic nature of neural networks. Consciousness is not a radio transmitter operating on a fixed frequency, but rather an emergent property arising from the intricate interplay of neural circuits operating across multiple frequency bands simultaneously.
