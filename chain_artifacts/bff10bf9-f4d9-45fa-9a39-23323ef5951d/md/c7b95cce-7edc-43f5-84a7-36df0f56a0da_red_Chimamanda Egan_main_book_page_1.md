The screen flickers, and for a moment I am not myself. I am @NnekaLagos2003, twenty-two years old, studying medicine at the University of Ibadan, passionate about Afrobeats and climate justice. I have never been to Lagos—I live in Connecticut—but here, in this space between keystrokes, I am someone else entirely. Someone braver, perhaps. Someone whose father did not die when she was seven, leaving behind only the smell of palm oil and unfulfilled promises.

This is the paradox of our digital selves: we become most authentic when we are most artificial. The username becomes a kind of prayer, a whispered hope of who we might be if geography and history had dealt us different cards. @NnekaLagos2003 speaks in ways I never could in my suburban American voice. She talks about colonialism with the authority of lived experience, though my experience of colonialism is filtered through my grandmother's stories and the books I devoured in the Westport Public Library.

But who is to say which self is more real? The one who fumbles through faculty meetings at the small college where I teach, or the one who commands thousands of followers with her insights about post-colonial literature? The boundary between performance and authenticity has always been porous—even before the internet made us all into actors on an infinite stage.
