Chapter 7: Digital Prophets and Corporate Oracles

The suppression of The Bandwidth Wars itself becomes a case study in the very phenomena it describes. When Galaxy Publishing's offices suffered that "accidental" fire in 1975—destroying nearly all remaining copies—the official investigation lasted exactly three days. The insurance payout came with unusual speed, and Galaxy Publishing never released another science fiction title.

F. Delany disappeared from public view shortly after the fire. My attempts to locate him for this study have been met with bureaucratic stonewalling that would make Kafka proud. The Social Security Administration claims no record of anyone by that name born in the appropriate time period. Galaxy Publishing's former employees, when I can find them, speak in nervous whispers about "corporate pressure" and "non-disclosure agreements that never expire."

Yet Delany's vision lives on in the underground networks of researchers and activists who recognize his work's prophetic power. Dr. Sarah Hendricks at Stanford's Information Ethics Lab keeps a photocopied excerpt pinned to her office door: "The war for bandwidth is the war for human consciousness itself. Those who control the flow of information control the very thoughts we're allowed to think."

This is precisely what the telecommunications giants fear most—not Delany's technological predictions, but his insight into the political implications of information control. When AT&T's chief technology officer dismissed my work as "academic paranoia" at the 1986 Communications Conference, he revealed more than he intended about corporate awareness of these dynamics.
