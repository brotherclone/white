Dr. Elena Vasquez disconnected from the research terminal with trembling hands, her consciousness snapping back to her physical body like a rubber band released at maximum tension. The laboratory around her seemed impossibly solid after hours spent navigating the fluid architectures of cyberspace, where thought took physical form and memories could be weaponized.

The data she'd extracted painted a terrifying picture. The major telecommunications consortiums hadn't simply been fighting for market share—they'd been conducting experiments on human cognitive bandwidth, testing the limits of how much information a networked mind could process before fragmenting entirely.

"The subjects in Trial Group Seven," she whispered to her voice recorder, "showed complete personality dissolution after exposure to high-density information streams for more than forty-seven minutes. Their individual identities became... distributed. Scattered across the network like leaves in a digital hurricane."

She paused, considering the implications. In 2047, the line between human and network had blurred beyond recognition. The Bandwidth Wars weren't just changing how people communicated—they were changing what it meant to be human at all.
