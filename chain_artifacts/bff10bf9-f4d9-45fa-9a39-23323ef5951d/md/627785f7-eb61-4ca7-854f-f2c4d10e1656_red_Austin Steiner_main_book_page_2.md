The breakthrough came during Operation MINDBRIDGE in late 1982. Using a modified Tesla coil array tuned to specific cognitive frequencies, we achieved unprecedented results in what the literature euphemistically calls "remote influence."

**Equipment Required:**
- High-frequency signal generator (minimum 50 MHz capability)
- Directional antenna array (recommend parabolic dish configuration)
- Spectrum analyzer with real-time FFT processing
- Isolation chamber (Faraday cage construction essential)

**Procedure:**
1. Establish baseline cognitive signature of target subject
2. Calculate harmonic interference patterns for desired mental state
3. Generate counter-frequency at 180-degree phase offset
4. Transmit focused beam at target location

**Results:** In controlled tests, subjects exposed to properly calibrated thoughtform interference exhibited measurable changes in brainwave patterns within 3-7 minutes. Emotional states could be shifted, attention directed, and in extreme cases, specific memories could be temporarily suppressed or enhanced.

*Warning: Prolonged exposure to high-intensity cognitive frequencies may result in permanent neurological damage. The author accepts no responsibility for unauthorized experimentation. This research was terminated by executive order in 1983 following the "Philadelphia Incident."*
