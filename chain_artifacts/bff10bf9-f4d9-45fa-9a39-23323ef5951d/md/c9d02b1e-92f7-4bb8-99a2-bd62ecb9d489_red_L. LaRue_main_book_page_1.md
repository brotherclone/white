Chapter 3: Digital Flesh Markets

The screen flickers with amber light as another transaction completes. Bodies reduced to data packets, compressed and transmitted through fiber optic veins that pulse beneath the city's concrete skin. I watch the numbers cascade—measurements, preferences, availability windows—each digit a fragment of someone's corporeal existence monetized and buffered for consumption.

The clients never see the warehouses. They don't need to. The interface abstracts away the messy reality of flesh and bone, presenting only clean metadata and preview thumbnails. Age: 23. Location: Sector 7-G. Status: Available. Specialties: [REDACTED]. It's all so clinical, so efficient. The human body transformed into just another commodity in the data stream.

But I know what lies behind those sterile listings. I've walked the corridors where they keep the inventory—row upon row of pods, each one containing a person whose agency has been compressed into a simple boolean: available/unavailable. Their dreams leak into the network sometimes, fragments of consciousness that slip through the buffers like ghosts in the machine.

The worst part isn't the exploitation—it's the seamlessness. How easily flesh becomes data, how readily the system optimizes human suffering for maximum throughput. Each click, each transaction, another soul fed into the great machine that never stops hungry, never stops processing.
