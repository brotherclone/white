*From Chapter 3: "Debugging the Default Reality" - Page 4:*

The first thing any competent programmer learns is that reality, like code, is full of bugs. These aren't mistakes - they're features of a system running on outdated consciousness drivers. Your parents installed DOS when you needed Unix. Your teachers uploaded FORTRAN when you were built for Python.

Most humans spend their entire lives running on legacy software, wondering why they keep getting error messages: anxiety.exe has stopped working, depression.dll is corrupted, meaning.bat file not found. They call tech support (therapy), run virus scans (medication), defragment their hard drives (meditation retreats), but never think to question the operating system itself.

The default reality program was written by committees of the unconscious, debugged by institutions with vested interests in keeping you running their preferred applications. School.exe, Job.exe, Marriage.exe, Mortgage.exe - all designed to keep your CPU busy with tasks that generate revenue for the system administrators while leaving you with barely enough processing power for the programs that actually matter: Love.exe, Wonder.exe, Presence.exe.
