**Chapter 3: Frequency Mapping of Cognitive Emissions**
*Page 47*

The human brain operates as a biological transmitter, broadcasting electromagnetic signatures that correlate directly with specific thought patterns. During my tenure at Fort Meade, we discovered that concentrated mental activity produces measurable field disturbances in the 8-40 Hz range—what I term the "cognitive bandwidth."

Using modified spectrum analyzers originally designed for SIGINT operations, we mapped the following frequency correlations:

**Alpha Thoughtforms (8-13 Hz):** Meditative states, passive observation, memory recall. These emissions appear as steady, low-amplitude waves with minimal harmonic distortion. Subjects in alpha states produce remarkably consistent signatures, making them ideal baseline measurements.

**Beta Thoughtforms (14-30 Hz):** Active problem-solving, analytical thinking, emotional processing. Beta emissions exhibit complex harmonic structures with significant amplitude variations. During intense concentration, we observed frequency "spikes" reaching 35-40 Hz—a phenomenon I've labeled "cognitive overclocking."

**Gamma Thoughtforms (30+ Hz):** Breakthrough insights, transcendent experiences, what some researchers incorrectly term "psychic phenomena." These high-frequency bursts are brief but extraordinarily powerful, often accompanied by localized electromagnetic anomalies that our instruments could barely register.

The implications are staggering. If thoughts emit measurable frequencies, then thoughts can theoretically be received, decoded, and potentially influenced through targeted electromagnetic intervention.
