Chapter 7: The Memory Merchants

Sarah's memories arrive in my inbox at 3:47 AM, compressed into a 2.3 gigabyte file marked "PREMIUM_EXPERIENCE_PACKAGE_001.mem." The attachment icon pulses softly, waiting for me to double-click and let her lived experiences flood my neural pathways. Fifteen years of intimacy, condensed and commodified for my consumption.

The memory markets operate in the shadows of the legitimate data economy, trafficking in the most personal currency imaginable: lived experience. They harvest memories from the desperate—those willing to sell their first kiss, their wedding night, their children's births—packaging them for clients who can afford to experience life secondhand.

I hesitate before opening the file. Once I jack in, Sarah's memories will overwrite portions of my own experiential matrix. I'll remember her lover's touch as if it were my flesh that trembled, her pleasure as if it were my own nervous system firing in ecstasy. The boundaries between self and other dissolve in the memory stream, leaving only the raw data of sensation and emotion.

The ethics are murky at best. Is it rape if the memories were sold willingly? Is it theft if the original owner retains copies? The law hasn't caught up to the technology, leaving us in a gray zone where consciousness itself becomes just another commodity to be traded, buffered, and consumed by those with sufficient bandwidth to handle the download.
