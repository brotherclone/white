The morning I first saw the Bandwidth Collectors descend from their chrome towers, I knew the world had changed forever. They moved like silver spiders across the sky-highways, their vehicles humming with frequencies that made dogs howl three blocks away. Mrs. Henderson next door was watering her plastic roses when the first one landed in Elm Street Park, crushing the old oak where children once carved their names into bark that remembered Lincoln.

"What are they?" she called to me over the fence, her voice thin as wire.

I watched the Collector emerge from its pod—tall, angular, wearing a suit that seemed woven from television static. It carried a device that looked like a tuning fork crossed with a butterfly net, sweeping it through the air as if harvesting invisible wheat.

"They're here for what we can't see," I told her, though I didn't yet understand what that meant. The Collector paused, turned toward us, and for a moment I felt something drain from my mind—not thoughts, but the spaces between thoughts, the quiet moments where dreams are born.
