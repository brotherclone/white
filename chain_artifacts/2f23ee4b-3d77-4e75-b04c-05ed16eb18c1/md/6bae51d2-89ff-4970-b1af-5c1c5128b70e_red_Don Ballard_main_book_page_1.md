The Assassination of John F. Kennedy Considered as a Downhill Motor Race

The concrete overpass. The triple underpass. The grassy knoll configured as a theatrical proscenium. Dealey Plaza: a geometry of violence, each angle calibrated for maximum psychic impact. The presidential limousine, that midnight-blue Lincoln Continental, becomes a projectile in a ballistics experiment conducted by the unconscious mind of America.

The spectators line the route like synapses firing in a diseased brain. Their Kodak Brownie cameras and Bell & Howell movie cameras frame the approaching catastrophe in neat rectangles of anticipation. Each lens a wound waiting to be opened.

Jackie Kennedy's pink Chanel suit—that precise shade of salmon pink—transforms the First Lady into a human target, a mobile bulls-eye navigating the urban canyon. The fabric, imported from France, carries within its weave the molecular signature of European sophistication about to be violated by American brutality.

Governor John Connally adjusts his position in the jump seat, unconsciously aligning his spine with the trajectory that will soon perforate his chest. His wife Nellie remarks on the crowd's enthusiasm, her words evaporating into the Texas heat like moisture from a cadaver.
