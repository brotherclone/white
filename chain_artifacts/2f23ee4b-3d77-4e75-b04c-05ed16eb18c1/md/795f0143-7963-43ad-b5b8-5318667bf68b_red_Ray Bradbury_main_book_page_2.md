The children were the first to understand. Little Tommy Brennan, who lived in the blue house with the crooked chimney, came running to me that evening with eyes wide as saucers.

"Mr. Spaulding," he whispered, "they're stealing the quiet!"

I knelt down to his level, smelling the summer dust in his hair. "What do you mean, son?"

"The spaces," he said, spreading his small fingers wide. "The spaces between the radio songs, between the TV shows, between when Mama talks and when she listens. They're taking all the spaces and putting them in jars."

I looked toward the park where the Collectors had set up their camp. Strange lights flickered there, and I could hear a sound like wind chimes made of broken glass. The boy was right—something was missing from the world, something I'd never noticed until it was gone. The pauses. The silence that let you think. The emptiness that made fullness possible.

"What happens when all the spaces are gone?" I asked him.

Tommy's face grew solemn. "Then there's nowhere left for the stories to hide."
