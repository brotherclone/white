Miranda's breath caught as Subject 47's eyes snapped open, glowing like twin Tesla coils. He sat up slowly, the electrodes falling away from his transformed flesh like dead snakes. When he spoke, his voice carried the resonance of high-voltage transformers.

"Doctor," he said, and the word made every piece of electronic equipment in the room hum in harmony. "I can feel them all."

"Feel what?" she asked, though she already knew. Her own modified nervous system tingled with recognition.

"Every electric current in the city. Every power line, every radio wave, every human thought crackling through synapses." He stood, his movements fluid as liquid mercury. "We're all connected now, aren't we? One vast neural network spanning the globe."

Miranda nodded, understanding flooding through her like a surge of pure electricity. This wasn't just about individual transformation anymore. Subject 47 was the first node in what would become humanity's next evolutionary leap - a species that could communicate through the very power grid itself.

Outside, the storm intensified, and somewhere across the city, another test subject was beginning to glow with that same otherworldly radiance. The Electric Age had truly begun.
