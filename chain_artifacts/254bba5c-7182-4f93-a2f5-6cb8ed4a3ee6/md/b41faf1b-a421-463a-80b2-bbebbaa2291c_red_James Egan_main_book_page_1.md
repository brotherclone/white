The machines hum their binary lullabies in the server farms of Silicon Valley, while I sit here with ink-stained fingers, writing by candlelight like some medieval monk copying scripture.

I began this memoir not as confession but as archaeology. Each memory I excavate reveals another layer of the great deception we've been living—that progress and connection are synonymous, that efficiency equals fulfillment, that the networked life is somehow more real than the one we abandoned. But what did we abandon, exactly? And why does its absence feel like a phantom limb, aching in weather we can no longer predict because we've forgotten how to read the sky?

The university ethics board that banned this work in 1973 understood something I'm only now beginning to grasp: that certain truths are too dangerous to speak aloud, not because they're false, but because they're devastatingly, irrefutably true.
