My daughter asked me yesterday why I don't use email. "It's faster, Dad," she said, her fingers dancing across her phone screen with the unconscious grace of a pianist. "You could reach anyone, instantly." 

But that's precisely the problem, isn't it? The terror of instant connection is that it eliminates the space where thought occurs—that pregnant pause between impulse and expression where wisdom has always lived. When I write a letter by hand, I must commit to each word before it appears. There's no delete key, no autocorrect, no algorithm suggesting what I might mean instead of what I actually think.

She looked at me with the particular mixture of pity and bewilderment that the digital natives reserve for us analog holdouts. I wanted to tell her about the weight of paper, the smell of ink, the way handwriting reveals character in ways that fonts cannot. I wanted to explain that speed isn't always virtue, that some things—love, grief, understanding—require the luxury of slowness to unfold properly.

Instead, I simply said, "Some conversations are worth the wait." She shrugged and returned to her screen, already forgotten me, already elsewhere.
