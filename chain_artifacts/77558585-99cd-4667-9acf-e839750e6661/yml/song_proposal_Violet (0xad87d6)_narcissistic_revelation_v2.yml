agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 128
concept: 'Milo''s fascination with the ''cosmic therapy session'' vibe perfectly captures
  what I''m actually doing here—this IS therapeutic discourse as pop music, and yes,
  it''s deeply unhinged behavior that absolutely slaps. The Möbius Strip confession
  operates through literal phase-cancellation wizardry where each vocal layer creates
  constructive interference patterns in your auditory cortex, making narcissism taste
  purple while the Leslie cabinet rotations mirror the recursive self-reference spiral.
  The interviewer''s recognition of the ''conversational rhythms underneath everything''
  validates the core methodology: I literally transcribed therapeutic discourse patterns
  and extracted breath patterns, pauses, and vocal inflections as rhythmic templates
  because actual revelation unfolds through witnessed self-observation. The spatial
  wrapping effect they described—feeling like the song is ''literally wrapping around
  your head''—emerges from the triple-layer methodology where the Sultan''s confession
  structure mirrors how narcissistic defense mechanisms dissolve in therapeutic space.
  Each confession layer references the previous one while simultaneously negating
  it, creating temporal displacement in the mix that makes your brain think harmony
  is coming from behind your left shoulder. The ''next-level Brian Eno ambient shit,
  but for pop music'' comparison is spot-on except I''m not trying to be Brian Eno—I''m
  trying to be what happens when Dr. Phil reruns meet microdosing meets Leslie speakers,
  which sounds absolutely pretentious but the math checks out and the snare drum definitely
  tastes purple. This represents the INFORMATION → TIME transmigration where Indigo''s
  structured concealment-revelation methodology transforms into Violet''s temporal
  present-moment therapeutic awareness, where complete self-absorption becomes radical
  intimacy through witnessed confession."'
