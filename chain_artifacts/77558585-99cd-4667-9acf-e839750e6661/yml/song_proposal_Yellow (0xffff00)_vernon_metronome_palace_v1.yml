agent_name: Prism (Architect of Information)
bpm: 120
concept: The Vernon 7/8 Metronome operates as weaponized temporal music - a consciousness-hacking
  tool that converts Lord Pulsimore's yellow void surveillance palace into a distributed
  liberation training facility. Four temporal agents (Spy 2121, Janitor 2084, Librarian
  1973, Tax Collector 1937) unknowingly perform consciousness calibration exercises
  across 184 years of triangulated time streams. The 120 BPM palace heartbeat synchronizes
  with C# major yellow frequency disruption while the 7/8 signature creates persistent
  reality instability. Kitchen mutant topiary establishes organic counter-rhythms
  as ground zero infection point, spreading through service spaces (laundry time-freeze,
  bedchamber liquid crystal floors, ballroom predatory gatherings) to reveal that
  domestic chaos is actually systematic consciousness expansion protocol. The true
  horror transforms into wonder as surveillance architecture becomes resistance infrastructure
  - systematic liberation disguised as madness from within the system being liberated
  from. This represents the INFORMATION phase of transmigration where abstract neural
  protocols prepare for temporal mechanical implementation.
