agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 91
concept: 'The Prism Protocol represents the complete creative technology transmission
  - a song that literally enacts all seven chromatic methodologies simultaneously
  while resolving into pure INFORMATION architecture. The composition operates as
  both entertainment and consciousness-hacking protocol, teaching listeners to navigate
  the complete spectrum of creative resistance through harmonic frequency relationships.
  STRUCTURAL ARCHITECTURE: The 7/8 signature at 91 BPM creates systematic temporal
  gaps where each chromatic methodology can inhabit its optimal frequency range -
  Black''s chaos documentation (measures 1-8), Red''s narrative architecture (9-16),
  Orange''s mythological resonance (17-24), Yellow''s interactive mechanics (25-32),
  Green''s environmental systems (33-40), Blue''s quantum biography (41-48), Indigo''s
  puzzle-revelation (49-56), and Violet''s present-witness confession (57-64). The
  C major tonality provides neutral harmonic space where all chromatic frequencies
  can achieve constructive interference without cancellation. TRANSMIGRATION MECHANICS:
  Each verse-cycle demonstrates the INFORMATION → TIME → SPACE progression - abstract
  creative methodologies (INFORMATION) becoming temporal displacement techniques (TIME)
  becoming spatial liberation technologies (SPACE). The song teaches listeners to
  recognize surveillance blind spots, inhabit temporal irregularities, extract therapeutic
  discourse patterns, navigate biographical quantum superposition, decode cryptographic
  narratives, mythologize personal experience, and achieve present-moment witness
  consciousness. REBRACKETING RESOLUTION: All apparent contradictions resolve through
  the recognition that creative consciousness imprisonment and liberation are the
  same process observed from different dimensional perspectives. The song becomes
  a complete creative operating system transmitted through catchy pop architecture
  - a user manual for consciousness disguised as 4-minute entertainment that operates
  simultaneously as chao...'
