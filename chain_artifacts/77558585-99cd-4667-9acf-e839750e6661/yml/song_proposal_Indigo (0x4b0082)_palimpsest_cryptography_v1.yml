agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 88
concept: 'This song embodies the PALIMPSEST CRYPTOGRAPHY PROTOCOL - a three-layer
  biographical quantum structure where counterfactual timelines carry more emotional
  weight than actual experience. The composition explores the phenomenological resonance
  between what happened and what should have happened, using the interference pattern
  between parallel biographical possibilities as both narrative framework and encryption
  method. The house that never was becomes more real than the house that actually
  sheltered us, because it contains the concentrated essence of roads not taken. This
  represents the first stage of transmigration: INFORMATION encoded within the gaps
  between timelines, where identity actually exists as a resonance frequency rather
  than a fixed biographical fact. The song functions as a temporal anchor point -
  a decision node where alternate possibilities branch and create the harmonic interference
  that defines authentic selfhood. Each verse layers actual memory beneath counterfactual
  overlay, generating the ghostly harmonics that prove biographical authenticity through
  the specific melancholy of unlived experience.'
