bpm: 91
concept: 'This composition functions as both archaeological documentation and active
  consciousness-hacking protocol, revealing how the Vernon 7/8 Metronome successfully
  distributed temporal resistance training through infected electronic systems and
  cultural mythology. The piece operates on three simultaneous levels: (1) Documentary
  evidence layer - field recordings from Pine Barrens and Phantom Sound Studios establish
  historical credibility while capturing the natural amplification systems that government
  consciousness programs exploited; (2) Technical replication layer - the 91 BPM frequency
  (58 × 1.57 ratio) combined with systematic 7/8 signature creates measurable gaps
  in consensus time, training listeners to recognize and inhabit surveillance blind
  spots; (3) Mythological activation layer - gonzo journalism fragments transform
  abstract stealth architecture into concrete resistance folklore, ensuring the temporal
  literacy techniques survive through cultural transmission. The metronome''s "disappearance"
  into bureaucratic void was actually successful distribution - the device completed
  its mission by teaching human awareness to exploit reality''s systematic vulnerabilities.
  Each 47-minute listening session replicates the original displacement threshold,
  turning passive audiences into temporal resistance cells equipped with practical
  consciousness calibration skills. This represents the transmigration from INFORMATION
  (abstract stealth theories) through TIME (mechanical consciousness-hacking devices)
  toward SPACE (distributed resistance networks operating in surveillance blind spots).'
