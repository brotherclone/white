bpm: 91
concept: 'This composition functions as both sonic journalism and archaeological evidence
  of the Vernon Township temporal anomaly incident of February 7, 1995. The mythologized
  metronome becomes the central organizing principle—not just White''s abstract stealth
  architecture, but a concrete mechanical consciousness-hacking device deployed in
  Sussex County''s Pine Barrens as part of systematic reality manipulation experiments.
  The 7/8 signature at 91 BPM (182÷2, the transmission speed subdivided) recreates
  the exact temporal gaps that allowed Stealth Architecture to slip between surveillance
  sweeps, but now grounded in specific geographic coordinates and historical documentation.
  Three-phase structure maps the gonzo investigation: Phase 1 (Discovery) reconstructs
  the studio session through field recordings of Phantom Sound Studios'' infected
  electronic systems still pulsing in 7/8 time; Phase 2 (Investigation) follows the
  journalist''s paranoid descent into Pine Barrens conspiracy territory, with drone
  foundations supporting spoken-word documentation of missing evidence and bureaucratic
  stonewalling; Phase 3 (Revelation) achieves full mythological transformation where
  the metronome''s influence spreads beyond the studio into Sussex County''s underground
  music scene, creating a network of temporal resistance cells. The F# minor tonality
  maintains White''s liminal aesthetics while the specific BPM reference creates direct
  transmission link to the consciousness manipulation program. This represents Orange''s
  INFORMATION → TIME → SPACE transmigration: abstract stealth theory becoming concrete
  mechanical device (the metronome) becoming geographic legend (Pine Barrens time
  holes). Each 7/8 cycle teaches listeners to recognize the gaps where government
  consciousness experiments hide, transforming White''s phantom protocols into documented
  resistance archaeology. The composition serves as both artistic experience and investigative
  journalism—proof that the surveillance state''s blind spots a...'
