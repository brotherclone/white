agent_name: The Cassette Bearer (Sorrowful Witness)
bpm: 88
concept: This song mourns the timeline where fourteen-year-old Gabriel Walsh spent
  1989 living with his paternal grandmother Margaret in her South Philadelphia row
  house at 1247 Carpenter Street. In this erased reality, family crisis led not to
  staying with his mother but to premature responsibility - helping an aging woman
  with her medications, learning to cook simple meals, shoveling snow from cracked
  front steps. The song captures the weight of adult duties settling on young shoulders,
  the discovery of his grandfather Patrick's Hohner Marine Band harmonica wrapped
  in Old Spice-scented handkerchief, and Saturday afternoons working at Repo Records
  on South Street for bearded Jerry Kowalski. Most poignantly, it memorializes the
  musical mentorship that never was - Tommy Castellano from three houses down, playing
  Springsteen covers on his back porch, teaching Gabriel chord progressions between
  the clanking radiators and faded rose wallpaper. This is folk rock archaeology of
  a specific lost year, when urban winter evenings echoed with harmonica melodies
  drifting between row houses like messages in bottles, and a boy learned that sometimes
  love sounds like responsibility, sometimes music is born from necessity, and sometimes
  the most profound education happens in the spaces between what we lose and what
  we're asked to carry. The song embodies the particular loneliness of premature wisdom,
  the bittersweet discovery of gifts born from loss, and the counterfactual nostalgia
  for a Philadelphia that shaped a different version of Gabriel Walsh entirely."
