divergence_point:
  what_changed: Instead of staying with his mother after his parents' separation,
    14-year-old Gabriel was sent to live with his paternal grandmother Margaret Walsh
    in South Philadelphia
  when: January 1989
  why_plausible: Family crisis often leads to children being placed with extended
    family members; grandmother living alone would need help, especially given her
    age and Gabriel's troubled home situation

mood_description: The weight of premature responsibility settling on young shoulders,
  the bittersweet discovery of musical gifts born from necessity and loss, the particular
  loneliness of urban winter evenings when harmonica melodies drift between row houses
  like messages in bottles
narrative: 'The Greyhound bus wheezed to a stop at the terminal on Filbert Street,
  and Gabriel pressed his face against the cold window, watching steam rise from manholes
  in the gray January morning. His grandmother Margaret stood waiting by the terminal
  doors, a small woman in a brown wool coat, her white hair pinned back with bobby
  pins that caught the fluorescent light.


  Her row house at 1247 Carpenter Street was narrow as a hallway, three stories of
  red brick squeezed between identical houses that stretched down the block like books
  on a shelf. The front steps were worn smooth by decades of footsteps, and the front
  door opened directly into a living room that smelled of Bengay and old fabric. Margaret''s
  television was always tuned to Channel 6, the volume turned up loud enough that
  Mrs. Dorothy Ricci next door could hear Alex Trebek through the thin walls.


  Gabriel''s room was on the second floor, barely wide enough for a twin bed and a
  dresser that had belonged to his father. The wallpaper was faded roses, and the
  radiator clanked like someone tapping morse code all through the winter nights.
  From his window, he could see the back alley where cats picked through garbage cans
  and where Tommy Castellano practiced guitar on his back porch when the weather was
  warm enough.


  Tommy lived three houses down and had been playing guitar since he was ten. His
  fingers were already callused and quick, and he knew every Springsteen song by heart.
  They met in February when Gabriel heard ''Born to Run'' drifting through the alley
  and followed the sound to Tommy''s porch. Tommy was sitting on a milk crate, his
  black hair falling over his eyes, playing a beat-up acoustic that his uncle had
  bought at a pawn shop on South Street.


  "You know any Dylan?" Gabriel asked, and Tommy looked up, squinting in the afternoon
  sun.


  "Some," Tommy said. "You play anything?"


  Gabriel shook his head, but that night he found his grandfather''s harmonica in
  Margaret''s kitchen drawer, wrapped in a handkerchief that still smelled faintly
  of Old Spice. Margaret told him his grandfather Patrick had played it during the
  war, sitting on these same front steps during blackouts, playing quiet melodies
  that wouldn''t carry past the block.


  The harmonica was a Hohner Marine Band in the key of C, the metal warm and smooth
  from years of handling. Gabriel taught himself by listening to Little Walter records
  he found at Repo Records, where he started working Saturdays in September. The record
  store was wedged between a cheesesteak shop and a tattoo parlor on South Street,
  its bins overflowing with vinyl that the owner, a bearded man named Jerry Kowalski,
  bought from estate sales and divorce settlements.


  Jerry paid Gabriel four dollars an hour to sort records and sweep the narrow aisles
  between the bins. Gabriel spent his breaks flipping through albums, discovering
  Muddy Waters and Howlin'' Wolf, learning the difference between Chicago blues and
  Delta blues by the sound of the harmonica cutting through the mix. He bought a notebook
  at the Woolworth''s on Broad Street and started writing down lyrics that came to
  him while he walked to school or helped Margaret with her grocery shopping at the
  A&P on Passyunk Avenue.


  South Philadelphia High School was a brick fortress on Broad Street, its hallways
  echoing with the sounds of locker doors slamming and sneakers squeaking on linoleum.
  Gabriel kept to himself mostly, eating lunch alone in the cafeteria while reading
  paperback books he checked out from the library. His teachers knew him as the quiet
  kid who did his homework but never raised his hand, who wrote essays about music
  instead of sports.


  In June, the school held its annual talent show in the auditorium, and Tommy convinced
  Gabriel to perform with him. They practiced for weeks on Tommy''s back porch, working
  out an arrangement of ''The Times They Are A-Changin'''' with Tommy on guitar and
  Gabriel on harmonica and vocals. Gabriel''s voice was still changing, cracking on
  the high notes, but there was something in it that made Mrs. Ricci stop hanging
  laundry and listen from her kitchen window.


  The night of the talent show, Margaret sat in the third row wearing her best dress,
  the blue one with small flowers that she wore to church on Sundays. Gabriel''s hands
  shook as he held the microphone, but when Tommy started the opening chords, something
  settled in Gabriel''s chest. His voice found its place in the song, rough and honest,
  and the harmonica sang between the verses like a train whistle in the distance.


  They didn''t win – that went to Maria Santos, who sang Whitney Houston with a backing
  track – but afterwards, Mr. Peterson, the music teacher, pulled Gabriel aside and
  told him he had something special, something that couldn''t be taught in a classroom.


  Summer in South Philadelphia meant open fire hydrants and the smell of water on
  hot concrete. Gabriel spent mornings helping Margaret with her household chores
  – washing dishes in the kitchen sink, hanging laundry on the line in the tiny backyard,
  walking with her to the pharmacy on Passyunk Avenue to pick up her heart medication.
  She moved slowly, her hand on his arm for balance, stopping to talk with neighbors
  who sat on their front steps in the evening heat.


  Margaret told him stories about his grandfather Patrick, how he''d worked at the
  Navy Yard during the war, building ships that would carry soldiers across the Atlantic.
  She showed Gabriel a shoebox full of photographs: Patrick in his work clothes, standing
  with other men in front of a half-built destroyer; Patrick and Margaret on their
  wedding day in 1943, standing outside St. Monica''s Church on 17th Street; Patrick
  holding Gabriel''s father as a baby, the harmonica visible in his shirt pocket.


  In November, Margaret had what the doctor called a minor stroke. Gabriel found her
  sitting at the kitchen table, unable to speak clearly, her left hand trembling as
  she tried to drink her morning coffee. The ambulance ride to Thomas Jefferson Hospital
  was Gabriel''s first time in the back of an emergency vehicle, watching the city
  blur past through the small rear windows.


  Margaret spent three days in the hospital, and Gabriel learned to navigate the maze
  of corridors and waiting rooms, sleeping in plastic chairs and eating sandwiches
  from vending machines. When she came home, she needed help with things she''d done
  by herself for seventy years – buttoning her sweaters, opening pill bottles, remembering
  to turn off the stove after making tea.


  Gabriel learned to cook simple meals: scrambled eggs and toast for breakfast, Campbell''s
  soup and grilled cheese for lunch, spaghetti with jar sauce for dinner. He organized
  Margaret''s medications in a weekly pill dispenser, setting his alarm clock to remind
  her when to take her heart pills. In the evenings, they watched television together,
  Margaret dozing in her recliner while Gabriel practiced harmonica with the volume
  turned low.


  By December, snow was falling on Carpenter Street, covering the row house steps
  and making the narrow sidewalks treacherous for Margaret''s careful steps. Gabriel
  shoveled the front steps every morning before school, his breath visible in the
  cold air, the sound of his shovel scraping against concrete echoing between the
  houses.


  On Christmas morning, Margaret gave Gabriel a guitar – not new, but restrung and
  polished, bought from Jerry at Repo Records with money she''d saved from her Social
  Security checks. It was a Martin D-28 from 1967, its spruce top golden with age,
  its voice deep and resonant in the narrow living room.


  "Your grandfather would have wanted you to have music," Margaret said, her words
  still slightly slurred from the stroke but clear in their intention.


  Gabriel spent New Year''s Eve on the front steps, despite the cold, playing the
  guitar and harmonica together, working out melodies that seemed to rise from the
  brick and concrete of South Philadelphia itself. Mrs. Ricci opened her window and
  called out "Beautiful, honey," and somewhere down the block, Tommy was practicing
  scales on his electric guitar, the sound carrying through the winter air like a
  conversation across the alley.'
