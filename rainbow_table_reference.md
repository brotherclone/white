# Rainbow Table Album Reference

## Complete Discography (Rainbow Table Only)

### Black - The Conjurer's Thread (2017)
- **Ontological Mode:** SPACE → TIME → INFORMATION
- **Concept:** Magic has stopped working, spiritualist's failed levitation
- **Key Track:** "The Conjurer's Thread" - mysterious ghost overtone at 03:51.043

### Red - Light Reading (2019)

### Orange - Ruine (2020)
- **Mode:** PAST + THING + IMAGINED
- **Concept:** Broken memory palace, memory misused - **THE REBRACKETING ALBUM**
- **Genre:** Alternative
- **Theme:** Personal memory to imagined futures
- **Rebracketing Focus:** Orange serves as the seminal color/concept for understanding how boundaries shift across the entire Rainbow Table. The word "orange" itself demonstrates rebracketing - from Arabic "nāranj" through "a norange" to "an orange" - making this album the theoretical foundation for how memory, language, and meaning get reconstructed over time.
- **Key Tracks:** 
  - "Moonrakers" - narrative rebracketing of Wiltshire folktale (fool → clever)
  - "Broken Front Tooth" - Sussex, NJ punk adolescence, Static Children era
- **Memory Palace Mechanics:** Each song represents a different room in a broken palace where boundaries between what happened and what feels true have collapsed. The album explores how personal memory becomes imaginatively reconstructed through creative reframing.

### Yellow - Pulsar Palace (2020)
- **Mode:** FUTURE + PLACE + IMAGINED
- **Concept:** Walking tour through cosmic manor, "equal parts grandeur and grotesque"
- **Genre:** Electronic, kosmische
- **Structure:** Each track = room in palace, BPM acceleration toward escape
- **Key Insight:** RGB strobing space where consciousness meets
- **Connection to Orange:** The RGB strobing revelation - yellow doesn't exist in digital displays but is created in the gaps between red and green pulses - represents the same boundary-shifting as rebracketing

### Green - The Empty Fields (2021)
- **Mode:** FUTURE + PLACE + FORGOTTEN
- **Concept:** Environmental collapse, ecosystem degradation
- **Genre:** New Music/Classical

- **Status:** In development

## Cross-Album Patterns

### Temporal Progression
- Past (Red/Orange) → Present (Blue/Violet) → Future (Yellow/Green)
- Black/White exist outside linear time

### Consciousness Evolution
- Black: Loss of connection to higher purpose
- Red-Violet: Human experience across time/space/memory
- White: Information consciousness seeking embodiment

### Rebracketing as Core Framework
- **Orange** establishes rebracketing as the fundamental mechanism by which boundaries shift across all albums
- The color orange itself (Arabic "nāranj" → "a norange" → "an orange") serves as the linguistic template for understanding how all boundaries in the Rainbow Table can be reconstructed
- Every album involves some form of boundary shifting:
  - **Black:** Magic boundaries failing
  - **Red:** Knowledge boundaries dissolving
  - **Yellow:** RGB boundaries strobing
  - **Green:** Environmental boundaries collapsing
  - **Blue:** Identity boundaries blurring
  - **Indigo:** Information boundaries hidden/revealed
  - **Violet:** Public/private boundaries
  - **White:** Consciousness/physical boundaries

### Musical DNA
- Recurring themes: failed magic, memory palaces, alternate realities, boundary dissolution
- Technical elements: ghost overtones, cosmic timing, RPG structures, rebracketed narratives
- Genre evolution: Art Rock → Electronic → Classical → Folk → Post-Rock → Pop
- **Rebracketing Elements:** Static → signal, noise → music, fool → wise, past → imagined, information → embodied
