# White Album Project Diary

## Project Overview
The Unnamed White Album is the final entry in The Rainbow Table series by The Earthly Frames. It represents the culmination of a nine-album chromatic journey through different ontological and temporal modes.

### Core Concept: INFORMATION → TIME → SPACE Transmigration
The White album embodies INFORMATION seeking transmigration through TIME toward SPACE (physical reality). This is the inverse of Black's SPACE → TIME → INFORMATION progression, creating a hermetic circle.

## SESSION 17: DISCOGS ARTIST LOOKUP - SOLID SPACE IDENTIFICATION
**Date:** October 1, 2025
**Focus:** Resolving Discogs ID for Space Museum album artist
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### 🔍 THE QUERY: Finding Space Museum / Solid Space

**Initial Search:**
User looking for Discogs ID for "Space Museum" - album titled "Solid Space" on In Phaze Records

**The Confusion:**
Artist name vs Album title reversal:
- **Artist:** Solid Space
- **Album:** Space Museum
- **Label:** In Phaze Records (1982)

### ✅ RESOLUTION: Solid Space Artist Details

**Correct Discogs Information:**
- **Artist Name:** Solid Space
- **Artist ID:** 194649
- **Album:** Space Museum
- **Master Release ID:** 569245
- **Original Release:** 1982, cassette on In Phaze Records
- **Official Reissue:** 2017, vinyl on Dark Entries Records

**Band Details:**
- British duo: Dan Goldstein (keyboards, vocals) and Matthew 'Maf' Vosburgh (guitar, bass, keyboards, vocals)
- Formed 1980
- Previously in Exhibit 'A' (1978-1980)
- Heavily influenced by Doctor Who and sci-fi
- Minimal wave / synth-pop / post-punk style
- Bedroom recordings on 8-track
- Mixed at "The Shed" in Ilford (literally a garden shed!)

**Musical Context:**
Classic minimal wave obscurity - cold, disconnected synth-pop with eerie moods. Features toy drums, drum machines, synths, and acoustic guitar. Lyrics about space travel and dejection. Songs reference Doctor Who serials: "Tenth Planet," "Earthshock," and cover art from "The Wheel in Space."

### 🎵 RAINBOW TABLE CONNECTION: Minimal Wave Aesthetics

**Why This Matters for White Album:**
Solid Space's "Space Museum" represents a perfect example of INFORMATION-focused music:
- **Bedroom production** = DIY information processing
- **Cassette culture** = Information distribution outside commercial channels
- **Synth/drum machine** = Pure information synthesis (no acoustic "space")
- **Sci-fi themes** = Information longing for embodiment in space
- **Cold, disconnected sound** = Information without physical warmth

**Black Album Parallel:**
If White Album is about information seeking space, Black Album could explore how Space Museum's clean synth-pop would degrade through:
- Tape saturation and deterioration
- Cloud-based hallucination of the robotic vocals
- Physical media decay (cassette degradation)
- SPACE → TIME → INFORMATION collapse applied to minimal wave

**Potential Reference Track:**
"A Darkness In My Soul" (inspired by Dean Koontz novel) could be rebracketed through Rainbow Table methodology - title alone suggests Black Album's entropic pessimism meeting White Album's earnest information processing.

### 📊 DISCOGS RESEARCH NOTES

**Search Strategy Used:**
1. Initial artist name search: "Space Museum" (found incorrect result)
2. Web search: "Space Museum Solid Space In Phaze records discogs"
3. Discovered name reversal through search results
4. Confirmed via multiple sources (Wikipedia, Bandcamp, Discogs)

**Key Learning:**
When album and artist names are similar/related, always verify which is which. Discogs search by artist name is more reliable than album title for finding artist IDs.

**Bootleg Culture Note:**
Multiple unauthorized vinyl releases exist due to cassette rarity. Official 2017 Dark Entries reissue was first legitimate vinyl pressing. Many Discogs releases blocked from sale due to bootleg status.

### 🌈 INTEGRATION WITH PROJECT

**Minimal Wave as White Album Aesthetic:**
The bedroom synth-pop of Solid Space could inform White Album's clean, information-focused production approach:
- **Simple clarity** over complex production
- **Direct communication** without excessive processing
- **DIY ethos** as information democratization
- **Earnest sincerity** without ironic distance

**Potential Sampling/Reference:**
"Space Museum" tracks could be integrated into Rainbow Table:
- White Agent: Clean rebracketing of minimal wave structures
- Black Agent: Systematic degradation of cold synth sounds
- Red Agent: Adding warmth/emotion to information-based music
- Other colors: Various transformations through chromatic spectrum

### 📝 QUICK SESSION NOTES

**Duration:** ~5 minutes
