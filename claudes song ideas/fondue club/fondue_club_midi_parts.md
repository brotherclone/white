```

**Guitar Tone:** Clean with deep reverb, maybe some tremolo
**Dynamics:** pp-p (very quiet to quiet)  
**Style:** Single notes, let ring, sparse and haunting

## Song Structure Suggestion
```
Intro (Bridge riff, 1x)
Verse 1 (Verse riff, 4x) 
Chorus 1 (Chorus riff, 4x)
Verse 2 (Verse riff, 4x)
Chorus 2 (Chorus riff, 4x) 
Bridge (Bridge riff, 2x + spoken word)
Final Chorus (Chorus riff, 6x)
Outro (Verse riff, fade with fondue bubbling sounds)
```

## Production Notes
- Layer the verse riff with a second guitar playing higher octave
- Add bass following the root notes
- Drums should be restrained in verse, driving in chorus, minimal in bridge
- Consider adding subtle analog synth pads in the background
- The bridge needs space for the whispered spoken word section
- Outro should include field recording of actual fondue bubbling

## Orange Album Context
This captures the PAST + THING + IMAGINED aesthetic perfectly:
- **Past:** 1980 New Jersey suburban setting
- **Thing:** The Fondue Club as concrete but mythical entity  
- **Imagined:** Memory palace broken between reality and legend

The musical progression mirrors the lyrical movement from atmospheric dread (verse) to mythic declaration (chorus) to whispered confession (bridge).
