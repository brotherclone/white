# "The Fondue Club" 
## (Orange Album Style - Verona/Lodi, 1980)

### Verse 1
Mrs. Patterson whispered at the copy machine  
About the kids who walk off cliffs for fun  
Down in Verona where the teachers live  
And the parking lot smells like cigarettes and rain  

The Fondue Club meets when the moon gets thin  
Behind the A&P where no one goes  
They melt their minds like cheese on bread  
And talk about colors that don't exist  

### Chorus
The Fondue Club, The Fondue Club  
Where suburban kids go to disappear  
The Fondue Club, The Fondue Club  
Walking off the edge of nowhere  

(And the Misfits practice down the street  
While your father grades his papers  
In a house that smells like coffee  
And the fear of teenage damage)  

### Verse 2
Tommy Morrison's older brother knew a guy  
Who said he saw them floating above Route 23  
Their eyes like headlights in the fog  
Their laughter echoing off the guardrails  

But that was back when maps still mattered  
Before the interstate cut through the woods  
When Lodi was just another exit  
And horror was still something you could touch  

### Chorus
The Fondue Club, The Fondue Club  
Where suburban kids go to disappear  
The Fondue Club, The Fondue Club  
Walking off the edge of nowhere  

(And Glenn Danzig's in his mother's basement  
Silkscreening skulls on t-shirts  
While you're five years old upstairs  
Listening to the teachers whisper)  

### Bridge
*spoken/whispered over minimal instrumentation*

"They found a pot on the cliffs.  
Still warm.  
Full of melted cheese and...  
other things.  
Things that made the dogs howl  
for three straight days."  

### Verse 3
Now the A&P is a CVS  
And the cliffs are just a memory  
But sometimes when the moon gets thin  
You can still smell the burning fondue  

Your father never talks about those kids  
The ones who walked right off the world  
But he keeps their names in his grade book  
Written in red ink that never fades  

### Final Chorus
The Fondue Club, The Fondue Club  
Where suburban nightmares came to life  
The Fondue Club, The Fondue Club  
Now it's just a story that might be true  

(And the Misfits made it out of Lodi  
But the Fondue Club just... dissolved  
Like cheese in acid rain  
Like memory in time  
Like children in the dark)  

### Outro
*fade out with distant sound of bubbling*

## Production Notes
- Use actual field recordings from 1980s New Jersey suburban environments
- Layer in distant Misfits-style backing vocals on the choruses  
- The bridge should sound like it's being told in a teacher's lounge
- Include subtle sound of actual fondue bubbling underneath throughout
- Tempo should be driving but slightly off-kilter, like a memory that doesn't quite line up

## Thematic Analysis
This represents perfect Orange album territory: PAST + THING + IMAGINED. The Fondue Club exists in that space where childhood overhearing adult concerns creates a mythology that may or may not be true. The broken memory palace mechanics are in full effect - the geography has changed (A&P → CVS), the context has shifted (pre-internet suburban isolation), but the uncanny residue remains.

The Misfits reference serves as temporal anchor - they're the "real" band that made it out of the same scene, while the Fondue Club represents the kids who disappeared into suburban legend. Perfect rebracketing material: taking whispered teacher concerns and adolescent rebellion and transforming them into something between horror story and nostalgic elegy.
