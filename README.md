This album will be generated by a neural network trained on the previous eight albums.

Workflow:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather the audio files, lyrics, and metadata from the previous eight albums.
2. **Process**: Extract audio, lyrics, metadata, and audio features from the previous albums and store them in a time-aligned, structured format.
3. **Conceptualization**: Using prompts, begin to create a new manifest file for the possible track.
4. **Manual Review**: Review the generated manifest file and provide feedback and scoring.
5. **Repeat the Concept and Review Steps**: Iterate on the conceptualization and review steps until a satisfactory manifest file is created.
6. **MIDI Generation**: Generate MIDI files based on the new manifest file. First chords, then melody, then drums, then bass.
7. **Lyrics Generation**: Generate lyrics based on the new manifest file for sections that require lyrics using the melody and chords as a guide.
8. **Audio Generation**: Create loops and one-shots that can be used with MIDI files to generate audio.
9. **DAW Integration**: Integrate the MIDI files and audio loops into a DAW additional recording such as guitar, vocals and other 'real' instruments.
10. **Final Review**: Review the final audio with LLMs and provide feedback.
