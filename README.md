# Unnamed White Album, the final LP in The Rainbow Table by The Earthly Frames

**The Rainbow Table** is a nine album series by The Earthly Frames, with each album representing a different color of 
the mnemonic rainbow. ROYGBIV. With the addition of black and, finally white, this project.

This album will be generated by a neural network trained on the previous eight albums.

## Workflow:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather the audio files, lyrics, and metadata from the previous eight albums.
2. **Process**: Extract audio, lyrics, metadata, and audio features from the previous albums and store them in a time-aligned, structured format.
3. **Conceptualization**: Using prompts, begin to create a new manifest file for the possible track.
4. **Manual Review**: Review the generated manifest file and provide feedback and scoring.
5. **Repeat the Concept and Review Steps**: Iterate on the conceptualization and review steps until a satisfactory manifest file is created.
6. **MIDI Generation**: Generate MIDI files based on the new manifest file. First chords, then melody, then drums, then bass.
7. **Lyrics Generation**: Generate lyrics based on the new manifest file for sections that require lyrics using the melody and chords as a guide.
8. **Audio Generation**: Create loops and one-shots that can be used with MIDI files to generate audio.
9. **DAW Integration**: Integrate the MIDI files and audio loops into a DAW additional recording such as guitar, vocals and other 'real' instruments.
10. **Final Review**: Review the final audio with LLMs and provide feedback.

## Recent Development: RPG-Based Generation System (September 2025)

### Major Breakthrough: Pulsar Palace RPG as Creative Engine

Developed a revolutionary approach using the existing Pulsar Palace RPG mechanics as a structured generation system for White Album tracks. This system transforms the game from simple entertainment into a sophisticated musical composition tool.

**Key Innovation**: Instead of starting with abstract neural network generation, we now use the RPG's narrative structure to create musically coherent track concepts that can then be refined through AI assistance.

### System Components Created:

1. **Expanded Palace Map** - Enhanced the original Pulsar Palace room structure with:
   - Complete RPG mechanics (ON/OFF stats, encounters, effects)
   - Musical character definitions for each space
   - Cross-album reference opportunities via Observatory room
   - Hidden rooms for special musical events (Memory Vault, Hidden Basement)

2. **RPG-to-Music Translation Framework**:
   - Character time/place origins → Historical musical influences
   - Room ON/OFF stats → Energy vs. ambient content balance  
   - Encounter types → Specific musical events (combat=dissonance, puzzle=modulation, etc.)
   - Party composition → Temporal layering of different musical eras

3. **Interactive Generator Tool** - React-based application that:
   - Generates character parties with temporal diversity (1727-2121)
   - Creates room progression paths for song structure
   - Calculates energy signatures and musical characteristics
   - Provides encounter-specific musical translation suggestions

### Temporal Layering Concept

Characters from different historical periods create rich musical fusions:
- 1727 Baghdad + 1973 London = Baroque complexity meets Glam Rock
- 1949 Berlin + 2121 NYC = Post-war experimental meets Future pop
- Multi-era parties create unprecedented stylistic combinations

### Sample Generated Track: "The Frequency Hunters"

Successfully generated complete track concept demonstrating:
- **Party**: Cursed Librarian (1953), Clumsy Detective (1949), Vengeful Librarian (1973)
- **Path**: Drive Way → Front Yard → Entrance → Vestibule → Drawing Room → Hidden Basement → Great Chamber
- **Musical Character**: Film noir + Krautrock + Glam progressive fusion
- **Structure**: 7 distinct sections following room progression
- **Duration**: 6:45 with detailed section breakdowns

### Updated Workflow Integration

The RPG system now enhances steps 3-5 of the original workflow:

**Enhanced Conceptualization (Step 3)**:
- Generate character parties using RPG mechanics
- Create room progression paths for song structure
- Calculate temporal influences and energy signatures
- Produce detailed musical translation parameters

**Structured Review (Step 4)**:
- Evaluate musical coherence against RPG logic
- Check narrative consistency of room progressions
- Assess temporal fusion effectiveness
- Score cross-album reference integration

### Neural Network Training Enhancement

RPG sessions provide structured training data:
- **Input vectors**: Room states, character compositions, encounter outcomes
- **Output vectors**: Musical parameters, harmonic progressions, structural decisions
- **Labeled examples**: Successful RPG-to-music translations
- **Quality metrics**: Musical coherence, narrative consistency, innovation measures

### Future Development: Real Game Session MCP Tools

Planning to develop MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for:
- **Session Logger**: Record actual RPG gameplay with musical decisions
- **Musical Event Tracker**: Log real-time translation of game events to music
- **Campaign Manager**: Track musical themes across multiple sessions
- **Real-time MIDI Generation**: Convert live gameplay to musical notation

This would create a feedback loop where human creativity drives RPG narrative, game mechanics provide constraints, and AI learns from successful sessions.

### Project Status

**Current Phase**: RPG-based conceptualization system complete and functional
**Next Phase**: Implementing MCP tools for real game session logging
**Target**: White Album generated from "greatest hits" of actual gameplay sessions

This breakthrough represents a fundamental shift from purely AI-generated content to **human-AI collaborative storytelling** that produces musical results. The RPG framework ensures structural coherence while human creativity provides narrative spark, with AI assisting in translation and refinement.

The White Album will thus complete the Rainbow Table series by demonstrating the "ontological through temporal to objectional" transmigration through an innovative fusion of gaming, storytelling, and AI-assisted composition.
