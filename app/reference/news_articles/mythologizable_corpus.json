      "text": "JACKSON TOWNSHIP \u2014 At least eight persons perished and eight were injured when a fire swept through the Haunted Castle attraction at Six Flags' Great Adventure amusement park last night.\n\nAll were visitors to the 500-acre amusement park and were believed to be teenagers, said Township Committeeman Richard Berry.\n\n\"Eight are known to have died and eight perished in the fire,\" Township Police Capt. Samuel DePasquale said. \"The fire spread so quickly because of the wind that apparently the victims had no time to escape.\"\n\nThe dead, burned beyond recognition, all were visitors to the 500-acre amusement park and were believed to be teenagers.\n\nAuthorities said they had to wait more than an hour while the rubble cooled before they could start picking through the debris.\n\n\"Initially, we thought they were mannequins, but then we knew something was wrong,\" Turnbach said.\n\n\"When I arrived,\" Assistant Fire Chief Samuel DePasquale said, \"the fire was engulfing the structure.\"\n\nWitnesses said the fire began about 6:35 p.m. and flames went as high as the trees. There was little billowing smoke \u2014 it was just a massive wall of flames, one witness said. \"It looked like a war zone.\"\n\nPark's visitors hear screams as flames soar, smoke billows\n\nJACKSON TOWNSHIP \u2014 Visitors to Six Flags' Great Adventure reported seeing \"big billows of smoke\" and \"flames as high as the trees\" as they realized something terrible was happening last night, and watched.\n\nOne of the photographers, John Fischetti, said he didn't see any panic among the patrons, \"just business as usual.\" Tom Flynn was walking toward Skeeball games. He said most people passing the Haunted Castle attraction as the fire started about 6:35 p.m. didn't see smoke until it was really bellowing out. The whole roof of the castle was covered with soot, said Joy Flynn, of Jackson Township.\n\n\"We were coming into the park, the whole sky lit up,\" said Mike Freeman, when the fire started. \"Even though we were about a mile away, we thought it was really bad. Smoke was billowing up into the air and everybody was still coming out of the park, and still others apparently entered to see what was going on.\"\n\nEventually, park officials decided to close the park and a stream of people was lined up on Route 537 to get out.\n\nPaul Bayer, Ocean County emergency management coordinator and chief of the Lakehurst Fire Co. for Ocean County Emergency Services, said the fire was brought under control \u2014 \"whatever that means\" \u2014 when he arrived.\n\n\"At 6:44 (the dead) would have to be identified through dental records,\" Turnbach said. \"But I know they were gathered together in one trailer, on a lit-up highway with everyone very upset.\"\n\nIn addition, an emotional woman gathered together with many people (as the park closed) handed out phone numbers and told a reporter that something traumatic had happened. They were very upset.\n\nTurnbach said it would take about a day or two to figure out who the victims were.\n\n\"A fairly thorough search was done,\" Bayer said. \"...I was shocked. Most of the victims were huddled together where there was nothing left to see that there was something there \u2014 an entrance or an exit, or smoke inhalation, trauma or all of the above.\"\n\nSome firefighters were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation, the Ocean County prosecutor's office said.",

      "text": "A 17-year-old Woodbridge boy was put on two-years' probation yesterday for desecrating a Roman Catholic church in Perth Amboy by spray painting Satanic symbols on the building and sidewalk.\n\nErnest J. Hennessy of Florida Grove Road in the Keasbey section of the township was sentenced by Superior Court Judge Richard S. Rebeck.\n\nRebeck also suspended Hennessy's one-year term in the New Jersey Training School for Boys and Girls in Monroe and ordered him to pay $600 toward cleaning up the spray-painted areas.\n\nAssistant Middlesex County Prosecutor Ernest Bergman had asked for a custodial sentence against Hennessy.\n\nPerth Amboy police arrested Hennessy on Jan. 10 outside Holy Spirit Church at Brace and Hazel avenues, four days after the church was marred by reddish paint sprayed on the columns.\n\nMiddlesex County Prosecutor Alan A. Rockoff, who announced Hennessy's arrest, said the youth marked the church with symbols of Satan \u2014 an upsidedown cross, \"666\" and the slogan, \"Satan Lives.\"\n\n\"Slayer,\" the name of a heavy metal rock group, was also sprayed on the church. Rockoff described Hennessy was a \"devoted follower\" of the group.\n\nPerth Amboy detectives were staking out the church on the night of Jan. 6-7 when Hennessy approached and began comparing the structure with photographs of the desecration from The News Tribune, a Woodbridge newspaper.\n\nPolice officers said Hennessy's jacket, sneakers and cap were stained with paint that matched paint found on the church.\n\nHennessy, who was 16 at the time of the offense, admitted a charge of criminal mischief \u2014 the actual spray painting. But he pleaded innocent and was tried for violating the state law against placing hate symbols or phrases on houses of worship.\n\nBergman said the judge also found Hennessy guilty of the latter offense.\n\nHennessy testified that he was neither motivated by satanism or heavy metal rock music. The defendant insisted he was simply intoxicated.\n\nJudge Rebeck also cleared Hennessy of a third offense \u2014 criminal mischief for toppling and damaging a $10,000 one-ton Italian-sculpted statue, \"Our Lady of the Rosary,\" on Dec. 13, 1985.",

      "text": "Continued from Page A1\n\nFleck, his school principal, \"died with Tom.\"\n\nYears before anyone jumped into the Satanism stuff as an explanation they should have looked at other possible causes, said Jerome Travers, a child psychologist for the former Catholic priest who has studied religious delusions.\n\n\"It's not a book that he read that caused him to kill his parents,\" Travers said, referring to three books on witchcraft in the boy checked out of the township library six days before the murder-suicide. \"It is what was going on inside him that caused it.\"\n\nTravers, who never met Tom but who has been following the case, said the boy had just experienced the first break with his parents sometime including religious delusions. Tom may have been in a severe family conflict that triggered the boy's rage. It appears Tom Sullivan Jr. died confused, angry and in turmoil, rebelling not only against his parents but against their conventions. It also appears the quiet 14-year-old was headed for trouble long before he showed any interest in Satanism. Interviews with neighbors and parents of the near-perfect child, \"the kind of boy you'd like for a son,\" as one neighbor described him, fit the normal life in the town.\n\nA gifted student, Tom earned a wrestling scholarship and from newspapers year-round to earn money. He was involved in sports, wrestling in a wrestling program and faithfully practiced matches. As a student he stood 5 feet, 7 inches tall, and he was strong. He worked out with weights in his bedroom to build his strength even more. He would sometimes sleep in his sweats, run five miles and force himself to run before matches to make weight, according to Nicholas, a school friend.\n\nHis principal described him as an average wrestler. Tom told a friend he planned to go to college on a wrestling scholarship. Young parents were, according to others, very happy with their son's success in their children's lives. Thomas Sullivan Sr., a hospital equipment salesman, worked with Tom at wrestling, and his mother told a neighbor she would even fake sick just to spend time with her son.\n\nTom's mother wanted him to get a job outside the house because she wanted to spend time with her son. \"They were a very close family,\" a neighbor, Dr. Alvin Stern, said.\n\nTom's days were full and carefully structured by his parents, police say. He followed the paper route in the morning, study time after school and wrestling meet nights. The boy had little free time, according to Police Chief Casper Stamer.\n\nBut in his unique free time, friends say, Tom slipped off the path he was on. Friends first noticed Tom's demeanor, his manner, had changed during the fall and definitely into the winter few of the adults who knew him would have suspected.\n\nHe began experimenting with alcohol in the fifth grade, said friends who drank with him and he puzzled liquor from his parents, he bragged of cheating on tests at school and would, the friends said, frequently drink in the bathroom.\n\nOnce he got caught, he said a friend whose name he wouldn't give, said he smoked marijuana and bragged about it before his friends said, frequently in the bathroom.\n\nTom's highly publicized interest in Satanism, which peaked just before the suicide to three books he checked out from the Fair Oaks Branch Library in Summit, apparently did not start that interest.\n\nHe began his studies shortly before his death at the Fair Oaks Branch Library. \"We visited several homes where Tom was visiting on Christmas vacation. He would come straight home from school to the living room of the small Cape Cod house and sit in a fire in the couch. His wife and son were not there. He looked depressed and was just staring down the driveway.\"\n\nNot long after, sometime before Christmas, Tom had an argument with his mother in which he cursed at her from his hands about 10 p.m. \u2014 Tom muttered words like his mother in words about it from Christmas vacation. His mother apparently was preparing for bed. She screamed him in the basement. She got a teen-slasher movie \"Friday the 13th\" was in the VCR, but nobody was watching it.\n\nPolice said there was no evidence of a struggle in any parts of the house where they lived. His mother said to each other, but the meeting is still under death.\n\nShe died on the floor near the family computer and her son was found a 6 feet away. She was stabbed more than a dozen times in the neck, back, and shoulders by a kitchen knife.\n\nTom left the basement, washed up and changed, then shot himself in a note he left that, police say, contained his mother's initial and a note inside that a short time after the murder he describes his mother's suicide type.\n\nThe note had no other text other than to say it indicated the killings were a mistake and they would kill him the day after the murder to describe his mother's suicide.\n\nThe boy probably felt trapped, Stamer theorizes, because the fact that Tom decided to kill himself.\n\n\"Looking back on it,\" Tom's classmates believe their friend changed so much the last days they said they knew about it. He wasn't his mother was no longer the one they knew. \"He wasn't like a classmate,\" Pfarr said in a statement. \"He was still a kind of person to do that to his mother,\" she'd play and a classmate, \"He was still nice.\"\n\nNick Ryder, another classmate, said he'd still be alive.\n\nSaid Michael's view, he'd still be alive.",

He teaches guitar, does some recording and crafts his own electric guitar known as the \"Barth Vader.\"\n\n\"It was Star Wars time,\" he says with a grin of embarrassment over the guitar's christening, but also with resignation.\n\nAt 34, Barth has been making guitars since 1976. He prefers hard woods \u2014 black walnut, ash, basswood \u2014 to craft the instruments. A Dover High School graduate, Barth says he's never had any formal instruction in guitar making. Instead, he learned the art the way mechanics learn their trade \u2014 by taking a guitar apart and putting it back together again.\n\n\"I started with repair work,\" he says. \"I saw how they made guitars for the industry and began figuring out how to make them better. Besides, there aren't too many schools to learn how to do it.\"\n\nHis last custom guitar devoured between 40 and 60 hours, he says, and cost about $1,000. He routs out the bodies on his band saw, glues the various parts together, sands them and then adds the electronics.\n\n\"I only know enough about electronics to assemble the parts,\" he says modestly. But his \"Barth Vader\" is somewhat unique in that he adds what he calls a graphic equalizer which allows the musician six tone controls.\n\nTeaching, repairing and band crafting, however, are only done to permit him to continue his true love \u2014 performing in a rock n' roll band known as \"Rocking New Jersey\" whose schedule includes local night clubs, private parties and weddings.\n\nThe name of the band can perhaps be linked to one of his favorite performers, Bruce Springsteen, who Barth claims has been one of the best influences in not only rock music, but its culture.\n\n\"It's a good, clean thing,\" he says. \"It's not violent, not stoney.\"\n\nWhile Barth isn't \"laughing all the way to the bank,\" as he puts it, he is doing what he wants to do, even if it means only a modicum of free time.\n\n\"It does get harder as the years go by,\" he admits, \"but I love it and the only reason I'm doing all this is to be able to get out and perform.\"",

      "text": "YOU HAVE just been attacked. Bruised and terrified, you make your way to police headquarters where you are asked to provide a description of your assailant \u2014 and suddenly discover that you can't remember any of the details of the attack.\n\nForensic hypnosis could help you recall the incident and put police on the trail of possible suspects.\n\nAlthough it is not a new technique, forensic hypnosis only recently has begun to gain acceptance by law enforcement officials as a way to gather information and help victims, witnesses and even suspects recall details of a crime.\n\nThe technique has been used to provide information in cases of homicide, rape, arson, burglary, robbery and assault, according to Peter E. Stoessler, a hypnosis consultant and director of the Siegfried Hypnosis Center in East Brunswick Township.\n\nStoessler and ANY of former State Trooper Francis M. Trammell, a hypnosis instructor for The Family YMCA of Ocean County, Lakewood, are organizing a course in forensic hypnosis to be offered to police departments and officers.\n\nTrammell said he suggested the course after he was approached by two Lakewood officers interested in learning the technique.\n\nHypnosis was used several years ago in a case involving a hit-and-run death in Lakewood.\n\nIn November 1974, Rabbi Jacob Katz of Lakewood was hit and killed at the intersections of New Hampshire and County Line roads as he was trying to cross Route 9.\n\nThe hit-and-run suspect approached police as they were aiding the rabbi, then said he had to get his license and registration and returned to his car. When police looked for him minutes later, the man had disappeared.\n\nUnder hypnosis, a patrolman recalled the license plate number of a car believed to have struck the rabbi.\n\nA police investigation using the license plate number led to the arrest of a suspect about two weeks later in connection with the death.\n\n\"THE FACT that he remembered the license number is not the evidence \u2014 from that point it was up to the police to prove that that was the car (that struck the rabbi),\" Stoessler said.\n\n\"It (hypnosis) can be used to protect ... but it is never used to gain a confession or a conviction,\" he said.\n\nStoessler, who will teach the course for police officers with Trammell assisting, hopes that at least 10 officers and students.\n\nThe course is expected to be taught at the hypnosis center in East Brunswick. Stoessler said. He and all officers or departments who wish to take the course can contact him at the center or Trammell at the YMCA.\n\nIn addition to law enforcement officials, psychologists and lawyers have used forensic hypnosis to obtain additional information in a case. As a general witness or relax a client prior to taking a lie detector test, Stoessler said.\n\nContrary to the popular conception of hypnosis, he said, and individual is not asleep and is not controlled by the hypnotist. A hypnotic state is not a sleep and is not being controlled by the will.\n\nANYONE CAN hypnotized to varying degrees, provided the subject consents to hypnosis and does not resist, Trammell said.\n\nA person under hypnosis may lose some sense of time, but will remember all or portions of the session and can be brought back to full consciousness at any time.\n\nNew Jersey has no law governing the use of forensic hypnosis to ensure that the information obtained will be admissible as evidence by the courts, Stoessler said.\n\nSESSIONS SHOULD be videotaped whenever possible, or at least tape recorded, he said.\n\nVideotapes are preferred because they prove that sections of tape have not been spliced and provide a visible record of the hypnotist, client, law enforcement officials and lawyers present, Stoessler said.\n\nThe manner in which the hypnosis session is conducted must ensure court scrutiny, he noted.\n\n\"If (the courts determine) you're leading the witness, the information is automatically thrown out as evidence because the questions might have put words in their mouth,\" he said.\n\nOnly certain questions can be asked to avoid producing \"leading\" or \"pseudo-memories,\" he said.\n\nPseudo-memories may result when a hypnotist asks \"leading\" questions. In such cases the subject may \"recall\" something that never actually happened, he said.\n\nIF THE VICTIM then recalls a hand with a scar, a set ring or some other specific information, the hypnotist can proceed to question the victim about those specific recollections.\n\nFor example, an assault victim remember a hand grabbed you, describe his hands or any part of his body you can remember, he suggested.\n\n\"A good question to ask would be, 'As the assailant grabbed you, describe his hands or any part of his body you can see,'\" Stoessler said.\n\nStudents also will learn the legal aspects and characteristics or events that are applicable to ensure that the information obtained will be accepted as evidence by the courts.\n\nParticipants in the six-week courses at the center will be trained in applying hypnosis. The forensic aspects and taught to apply these techniques to questioning and working with witnesses, victims or suspects.\n\n\"Hypnosis is always used to give you the lead \u2014 the missing link \u2014 but you need more information to go on,\" he said.\n\nFurther police investigation is necessary before any arrest can be used as evidence in making arrests, he said.\n\n\"All sorts of emotional factors play a role in hypnosis, and the hypnotist has to be aware of this and phrase his questions accordingly,\" he noted.\n\nA system of ethics for revenge could be under hypnosis and deliberately accuse an innocent of a crime, he explained.\n\nINFORMATION OBTAINED through hypnosis is not sufficient for police to immediately arrest anyone, Stoessler emphasized.\n\nA Los Angeles police survey of 878 cases involving hypnosis from 1975 to April 1979 showed that new information obtained through hypnosis was utilized in 80.2 percent of the 126 cases solved.\n\n\"Hypnosis is always used to give you the lead \u2014 the missing link \u2014 but you need more information to go on,\" he said.",

      "text": "CLIFTON (AP) \u2014 A 17-year-old strangled as he sat praying in his father's car was the target of an earlier death plots by five teen-agers who met in weekly planning sessions since November, authorities said yesterday.\n\nRobert Solimine Jr. of North Haledon was throttled with an extension cord by a 17-year-old acquaintance sitting behind him in the back seat and proceeded to strangle him as they prayed a \"Hail Mary,\" Passaic County Prosecutor Ronald Fava said.\n\n\"When they got to the line, 'Now and at the hour of death,' he flipped his cord around his seat and proceeded to strangle Mr. Solimine,\" Fava said.\n\nSolimine's body was found in the car at 12:30 a.m. Monday morning in a school parking lot. The killing happened sometime after 11 p.m. Sunday night.\n\nTwo 17-year-olds, two 14-year-olds and Frank Castaldo, 18, are accused of murder. All are from Clifton. Names of the juveniles were not released by authorities.\n\nCastaldo was not present at the time of the killing, but the youths met with him before it and afterward, Fava said.\n\nThe 17-year-old alleged killer bought religious medals with an image of St. Joseph and the infant Jesus for the members of the group as a symbol of solidarity, Fava said.\n\nAuthorities are puzzled about the motive.\n\n\"There is no reason that rises to the level of what a reasonable, rational person would consider a motive for murder. There was some indication (Solimine) wasn't their favorite person, that he was considered something of a pest.\n\n\"But those are reasons not to invite someone to your birthday party; they do not rise to level of wanting to kill someone,\" he said.\n\nFava said the group began in November at Castaldo's home to plan to harm Solimine. They first considered vandalism, such as slashing tires, then escalated to planning physical harm and then murder, Fava said.\n\n\"At some of these meetings, they would begin with readings from the Bible,\" Fava said.\n\nTwo earlier death plots failed. In the first attempt in January, the group planned to force an aerosol can into Solimine's gas tank, thinking it would heat up and explode as he drove the car, Fava said. They were unable to force the can down the gas pipe, and if they had, gas tanks do not get hot, Fava said.\n\nOn Saturday, the night before the murder, the group planned to trick Solimine into handcuffing himself to his steering wheel, then they would set fire to the car, Fava said.\n\n\"They were going explain they were some kind of trick handcuffs, and see how long it would take him to get out. He apparently was suspicious enough to decline to be handcuffed,\" Fava said.\n\nFava said Castaldo appeared to be the group's leader.\n\n\"The 18-year-old appears to have had some control over the group. He ran the meetings,\" he said. \"He had approval or veto power over plans.\"\n\nEarly Tuesday, charges had only been filed against the 17-year-old accused of actually strangling Solimine and a 14-year-old who was in the car with him.",

Timestamp burn-in shows 8:47 PM - 10:00 PM. Audio has that compressed VHS quality where whispers are too loud and normal speech distorts. The leader, Frank Castaldo, keeps saying \"from the top\" and \"let's try that again with more conviction.\" The tape ends mid-sentence. It's been circulating through extreme cinema collector circles since 2003 as \"The Clifton Rehearsal Tape\" - more disturbing for its theatrical banality than its content. They workshop homicide with the same earnest energy as a high school production of Our Town. Nobody knows who was holding the camera.",

The largest shard - eight inches long, still bearing dancing bear blotter residue - was kept by Emily for fifteen years in a shoebox under her bed. In 1997, after receiving cryptic letters from the psychiatric facility where Lisa had been institutionalized, Emily ground and shaped the glass into a blade following diagrams Lisa had drawn. The letters spoke of \"cutting a new door\" - staff dismissed this as psychotic rambling, but Emily understood. She wrapped the knife in original dancing bear blotter paper, hid it inside a hollowed-out Bible, and smuggled it into the facility during visiting hours. Three days later, Lisa vanished from her locked room. No blood. No broken windows. No body ever found. Just an empty bed and the faint smell of ozone. The knife was never recovered. Emily Chen disappeared six months later, leaving only a note: \"I helped her cut the door. Now I'm going through.\"",

      "text": "MORRIS PLAINS \u2014 The problem, the slight, gray-haired man was saying, is that we have become too \"beta-bound.\"\n\nWith the help of an electronic tracking device, Jose Silva, founder of Silva Mind Control, the method to \"help you become more humane,\" was sinking into alpha.\n\nThe silence became more pronounced in the room as the beeps indicating beta or conscious mental activity slowed down deeper into the subconscious regions of alpha.\n\nThen, with rapid hand and wrist flexes, Silva surfaced again and opened his eyes to the world of beta.\n\nIn town this weekend to help promote the method through a new graduate course, Silva visited the Mind Control bookstore named after him at 1012 Mount Tabor Road.\n\nMind control, Silva said, to the small audience of observers seated in the training room adjoining the bookstore, is a \"method of mental training which helps human beings use the subconscious consciously.\"\n\nHe speaks softly, this man who has triggered a movement with more than half a million devotees worldwide. The promises of what mind control yields are almost as numerous as the numbers of individuals who join the introductory $175 course.\n\nNew jobs, better education, improved relationships \u2014 the list is endless. Because as \"persons become healthier, more productive, they become problem-solvers,\" Silva says.\n\n\"We're using another dimension of the brain,\" he explained. And there are no limitations, in his opinion, to the power of that facility. \"You become more developed. It's like,\" he says, straining to relate to the uninitiated, \"using two tool boxes to do the job instead of one.\"\n\nSilva's own interest in psychology was triggered during some testing he was in the Army in 1944. \"I wondered what that man was doing to me,\" he remembers. Later as an electronic engineer, Silva, a Mexican-American who began with three years of formal education, became interested in knowing \"if we could arrest frequency.\"\n\nHe likened the brain to a transmitter-receiver unit. \"When impedance equals zero,\" he discovered, \"there is minimal opposition to resistance and the greater use of electrical energy. Then,\" he beams, \"you've reached resonance.\"\n\nIn other words, you're there. \"In synchronization, in step, and not wasting energy,\" according to mind control principle. You've reached alpha \u2014 sleeping consciousness one step beyond the limits of conscious beta \u2014 the \"resonant point\" in the brain.\n\nBy 1966, Silva and several groups had experimented with several groups of people in his native Texas. He began to branch out in 1970, and barely five years later mind control is an accredited course in some high schools, with several universities due to follow suit.\n\n\"The reason for success is a simple one for Silva. \"You change your way of thinking,\" he claims. \"You just don't want to use other people. You cannot think evil at alpha. If you did, you would get bounced back to beta.\"\n\nFor a brave new world is the ultimate goal of mind control. Silva himself will admit his \"ultimate goal\" is to have \"everyone\" learn mind control.\n\nThere are tests under way now analyzing whether children \"inherit\" the mind control principle from parents who demonstrate that principle in their lives.\n\nThus, he enthuses, mind control is \"the first step of the second phase of human evolution of the planet. The world will become a better place, in short.\n\nThere are many questions yet unanswered Silva will admit to. \"Mind control is a hypersensitive means of perceiving information the means of which we don't yet understand fully.\" Present tests also have gotten \"interesting feedback\" from a force Silva conceptualizes as the \"center of the galaxy.\"\n\n\"We have reason to believe,\" he says, smiling, \"the results have been so promising, that there's something there.\"\n\nBecause, after all, \"alpha is the direction we came from.\"",

      "source": "Vineland Times Journal",
      "text": "WARSAW, Poland (AP) - As a crowd of young punks brawled on the dance floor, the lead singer for Dezerter - the deserter - screamed out an anthem to what he called Poland's \"miscarried generation: No goals, no future, no hope, no joy.\"\n\nThe singer hurled stacks of government and Communist Party newspapers into the crowd of 200, while shrieking the word \"propaganda.\" The title of the song was \"News.\"\n\nThe teen-agers shredded the papers, and lunged at each other with fists, feet, legs, and bodies in a desperate frenzy which resembled a fight more than a dance.\n\nThe Polish punk rock movement is small - several thousand, according to long-time observers of the Polish musical scene - and typifies the lag in popular culture between Western and Eastern Europe. But it reflects the disorientation of many Polish youth.\n\n\"I like punk because it's the only music which lets us get our aggression out,\" said one 18-year-old boy, wearing a studded leather jacket and cropped blond hair that he stood on end by donating in sugar-saturated water.\n\n\"If Solidarity is said to find in Poland, where clothes of all kinds are scarce, he said, grinning, 'but we steal them.'\"\n\nWhile looking to the West for musical and other cultural values, Polish teen-agers feel themselves firmly in the political grip of the Soviet bloc.\n\nPoland's communist authorities barely tolerate punk but see it as a \"safety valve\" for the nation's disaffected youth, according to one sociologist.\n\nRecent times have been confusing for Polish teen-agers, who first lived through the heady upheaval led by the now-outlawed Solidarity labor federation, then endured 18 months of martial law.\n\nNow they face an economic crisis which many say will confine them to frustrating jobs and deny them a house of their own until they reach middle age.\n\n\"Why were if you have to wait 20 years for an apartment?\" asks 16-year-old Rikardai, lead singer for Dezerter and a vocation school drop-out who refuses to give his real name.\n\nJerry Kordowicz, a disc-jockey for state-run Polish radio, said in a recent interview that \"Polish punk is a social phenomenon rather than a musical one. It is the spontaneous protest of a generation, not only in political matters but in cultural ones as well.\"\n\nState radio which regularly features Western rock bands, rarely broadcasts Polish punk, Kordowicz says, because \"the lyrics of punk songs don't deserve to be played over the radio.\"\n\nIts aim of radio is to popularize certain cultural values,\" he said.\n\nGovernment censorship blocks most Polish punk from the airwaves, and bans some songs from concert. Last year Dezerter was called SS-20, after the new generation of Soviet nuclear missiles, but dropped the name after authorities refused to print a poster for the group. The group renamed itself Dezerter - a controversy name in martial law Poland.\n\nAnother rock band, Perfect, came under government harassment when it began replacing the line \"We want to be ourselves\" in one song with \"We want to beat ZOMO,\" a reference to Poland's riot police.\n\nAnother Perfect lyric, \"Don't be afraid of anyone,\" became, in concerts, \"Don't be afraid of Jaruzelski,\" a jab at Poland's leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski. It also upset authorities.\n\nPunk groups have also been banned from giving concerts from time to time - such was the case during Pope John Paul II's visit to his homeland in June.\n\n\"Punk here is just like anywhere in the world,\" says Dezerter manager Tomasz Wisniewski. \"Punks here don't respect the authorities, but playing punk here is more difficult, because of the censorship and hard to get instruments,\" says Kordowicz. For the most part, only those bands that cross the line from punk to music with more popular appeal have recorded albums by the state recording monopoly, he said.\n\nMost of the 100 or so new wave bands are amateurs, according to Kordowicz.",

Smalley is being held in Cumberland County Jail in lieu of $1,000 bail.\n\nArrested at the Vineland State School where she works was Florida Mary Nocco, 26, also of the Howard Street home, whose father, William, heads the CETA program here. Miss Nocco was charged as a disorderly person for allegedly removing the proper label from the original container of a prescription drug she was issued a summons and released.\n\nAlso arrested was William Kenneth Herring, 28, of the Howard Street address. Herring was charged with possession of a controlled dangerous substance (over 25 grams) with intent to distribute. He was freed on $10,000 bail.\n\nThe second raid took place at 12:05 a.m. when five police officers armed with a search warrant to the second floor apartment of Cliff Smalley and Kenneth Dickenson, no given. Police said Smalley, who opened the door, said at the time he didn't know where Dickenson was wherabouts.\n\nInside the apartment, police allegedly found five fish tanks with \"magic mushrooms\" growing inside them had been placed in the tanks in order to grow the psilocybin mushrooms, police said.\n\nAccording to police, other drug-related paraphernalia was uncovered in the kitchen and bathroom. Police also allegedly found a small amount of marijuana (under 25 grams).\n\nSmalley has a charge against whom charges are pending, allegedly (Continued on Page 44)",

Warth, president of the Society for the Investigation of the Unexplained.\n\nThe group, which Warth claims has \"thousands\" of members across the globe, investigates everything from lights in the sky to household ghosts in a quest to provide scientific facts about things most of us consider science fiction.\n\n\"We're interested in just about all unexplained phenomena. We try to keep up with everything and report to our members,\" Warth said.\n\nA recent edition of the organization's quarterly journal, \"Pursuit,\" is filled with articles providing scholarly updates on such topics as possible methods of UFO propulsion, the sighting of a food-tail lizard man in South Carolina and references to werewolves in Shakespeare's plays.\n\nWhile group members claim there is more than a germ of truth in most tales of the unexplained, Warth said the organization doesn't try to force its views on unbelievers.\n\n\"We don't take any stands on ed skepticism,\" Warth said. \"If someone is interested in the unexplained we only ask them to read both sides, do their own research and think.\"\n\nBut Warth is a true believer. He counts psychic speller Uri Geller among his close friends, and claims another psychic friend healed his wife who suffered a kidney ailment.\n\nHe claims to have seen UFOs and believes almost everyone has some untapped psychic ability.\n\n\"One of the biggest problems we have as human beings is that we are very limited by our vision. We don't believe in something unless we can see it,\" he said.\n\n\"Pursuit\" is published from a spare bedroom on the second-floor of Warth's Victorian home in Monmouth County.\n\nThe house is also home to Warth's many cats and his wife's collection of antique clocks, both of which add a gothic atmosphere to the premises.\n\nA devotee of the unexplained from an early age, the 57-year-old man has been president of the society since 1975.\n\nIn addition to editing the magazine, Warth's duties as president involve taking phone calls from people who have suddenly had an encounter with the unknown.\n\n\"When we get a call, I'll screen the people to make sure they aren't part of the lunatic fringe. If it's a significant incident, we'll go to the site and investigate,\" said Warth, a professional chemist who receives no salary from the society.\n\nWhile screening calls, Warth keeps in mind that most people aren't accustomed to having dealings with the supernatural.\n\n\"Seeing a ghost for the first time can be pretty unnerving,\" he said matter-of-factly.\n\nWhen visiting a house suspected of being haunted, Warth brings along a psychic who can tell if there is a spiritual presence nearby. Warth also asks the homeowner to write down as much information as possible about the sighting and the history of the problem.\n\n\"People worry that having a ghost will lower their property values,\" Warth explained.\n\n\"The society can also provide assistance with the problem. Help, in most cases, usually involves gently informing the ghost that it is, in fact, dead, Warth said.\n\n\"A ghost basically feels they are still alive. They can't understand why there are strange people in their house. They don't like the changes that are being made so they annoy the residents,\" Warth said. A one-year membership in the society is $30 and includes a subscription to \"Pursuit.\"\n\nAnyone interested in joining should write: SITU URSUIT, P.O. Box 265, Little Silver, N.J. 07739-0265.",

Oklahoma investigators saved a few satanic drawings and writings by a boy who had killed his parents; relatives threw away the rest.\n\nThey know better now.\n\nPolice, parents, teachers and clergy have learned some tough lessons about hard-to-believe phenomenon as dark as it is complex. Violence and crime among teen-agers caught up in the occult, particularly a self-styled Satanism laced with drugs, savage rock music and a mish-mash of symbols and rituals, have adults talking seriously about the unspeakable.\n\n\"Three years ago, nobody wanted to hear it, nobody wanted to believe it was real,\" said San Francisco police Det. Sandi Gallant, who recently received four calls a day from around the country on crimes with satanic or occult overtones. \"Now I'm seeing them tuning into it, looking to see if it's a reality and finding it does exist.\"\n\nAuthorities around the country are seeing a rise of violence and crime among teen-agers caught up in the occult, particularly a self-styled Satanism laced with drugs, savage rock music and a mish-mash of symbols and rituals.\n\n\"The paranoid fantasy is becoming a major social problem,\" said Carl Raschke, director of the Institute of Humanities at the University of Denver. \"If you're looking for it, you don't see the evidence. But when you're looking for it, you see it everywhere.\"\n\nIn one month this winter, three Missouri teen-agers were charged with first-degree murder in the death of a classmate beaten with baseball bats and dumped into a cistern. A popular 15-year-old put a rifle to her head in Vermont. A New Jersey eighth-grader fatally stabbed his mother with a Boy Scout knife, then slit his throat and wrists.\n\n\"The kids will tell you themselves: 'What have we got to live for?' You've crammed religion down our throats. You've destroyed everything. You've built bombs that can wipe out the world. So we live for today,'\" said Denver police Det. Bill Wickersham. \"That's what Satanism says \u2014 'Do what thou wilt.' \"\n\nAt Chicago-based Cult Awareness Network, every month brings news of a teen-ager involved in crime believed to be linked to devil worship. At least 10 percent of the 250 calls they receive each month are about satanic cults, a significant rise from previous years, said Cynthia Kisser, the group's executive director. \"I believe we're only getting the tip of the iceberg,\" said San Francisco's Gallant.\n\n\"I suspect we're only getting the tip of the iceberg,\" San Francisco's Gallant said. \"I believe for every one we're hearing about, there are five we haven't picked up on.\"\n\nIt's easy to see why. Thomas Carl Sullivan Jr., 14, a paperboy appeared to be a model son and student until a month before he killed his mother, Betty Ann, and himself. Michael Kimball, 15, before she put a bullet through her brain, was considered a giving, loving child who brought light into others' lives. James Hardy, one of three 17-year-olds charged in the beating death, was a senior and athlete at St. Thomas the Apostle High School in Kansas City.\n\nSatanism, which revels in evil, destruction, instant gratification and ritual guaranteed to shock parents, offers the ultimate rebellion.\n\n\"It's a shortcut to power, and the only thing you have to do is stick your neck out. There's this element of danger,\" said Linda Blood, a former member of the Temple of Set, a group of traditional Satanists.\n\n\"It's like the occult version of The Revenge of the Nerds.\" Are kids involved in self-styled Satanism \u2014 separated from the traditional religious Satanists, who are public about their beliefs and disapprove of criminal activity, and adult devil cults, which some observers believe use drugs and blackmail to lure desperate teenagers into drug-related crimes \u2014 seeking rebellion into the realm of the bizarre.\n\nSuffice it, for example, became \"Malakas,\" adopting some of the outward trappings: black clothing, inverted crosses, encircled pentagrams, goat heads or the number 666 worn as jewelry or drawn on notebooks.\n\nSome rob graveyards to get what they need.\n\nDrugs play a major role, especially amphetamines, PCP and hallucinogens such as acid. Satanism and drugs were the glue for the Purple Knights, a gang of Denver-area teen-agers, some as young as 12, involved in burglaries, suicide attempts, auto theft and arson.\n\nPlease see 'Satanism, page 2",

E. Etzel, a spokesman at state police headquarters in Trenton, said only three of those arrested in the Saturday night melee after the concert by Iron Maiden and Waysted were juveniles. Two cars were overturned and set afire before the arrests.\n\n\"Don't call them kids,\" Etzel said. \"For the most part these were adults age 18 or over.\"\n\nThe charges against the 33 included aggravated assault with a motor vehicle, simple assault, trespassing, criminal mischief and creating a disturbance, said State police Sgt. Robert Martin.\n\nEtzel said a state trooper suffered minor injuries during the fracas and that no one else was hurt.\n\nPaul Wolcott, a spokesman for the operators of the Meadowlands, said it was his understanding that the group was much smaller and that there were 15 to 20 arrests of people refusing to leave and some motor vehicle summonses. Wolcott, who works for the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, said he also believed that only one car was either set on fire or caught fire.\n\nRobert E. Mulcahy 3rd, the chief executive officer of the sports complex, said Sunday night that the authority would take action regarding future heavy metal concerts, if necessary.\n\n\"If the reports from our own security people and the state police lead me to conclude that this policy (of having heavy metal concerts at the Meadowlands) should be revised, I am prepared to make such a recommendation to the board,\" Mulcahy said in a statement.",

No member of Black Vomit does drugs. We do not now and never have advocated drug use. In fact, several of our songs are against drug and alcohol use and/or abuse. Associating Black Vomit with drugs was not only an extreme blow to our reputation, but also shows a lack of research on behalf of The Home News. Being a small local band is difficult enough without the negative association you have now placed upon us.\n\nThe article also associated drug use with punk rock in general. This, too, came as a shock. The majority of so-called punk rock bands are against drugs. There is even a growing movement known as Straightedge that believes in an open-minded, drug-free (including alcohol- and cigarette-free) positive life style. The girl in the article obviously had problems, but music was not the cause of them.\n\nWe feel The Home News has the obligation to negate the image they have placed upon us.

Astrology, witchcraft, and even some so-called religions attract followers with promises of \"presto\" answers and the chance to identify with an \"in-group,\" believes Prof. Larry Axel.\n\n\"The occult has deep historical roots,\" adds history Prof. John Conrtreni, a specialist on the medieval period.\n\nFor centuries, individuals have turned to the supernatural through methods such as magic, alchemy and spiritualism. Through these, they have tried to enhance their powers, protect themselves from evil forces, or predict the future.\n\nEVEN THE so-called natural sciences were in a sense occult in their beginnings. According to historians, most early scientists were considered magicians or sorcerers because of the mystery involved in their investigations.\n\n\"Despite all our technological expertise, people still feel a need to appeal to supernatural forces,\" Contreni observes.\n\nIn the past, practitioners of the occult were not always accepted as readily as we might regard a newspaper horoscope today. Frequently, alleged witches and sorcerers were persecuted.\n\nA WITCH might be the hit of a cocktail party in 1979, but her centuries-ago predecessors would have been afraid to admit their beliefs, much less talk about them openly,\" says communications professor William Whalen, also a specialist in religions and author of an upcoming book on cults.\n\nWhalen attributes much of the current occult interest of young people partially to \"kicks\" and an opportunity to reject the value systems of their parents.\n\n\"It also has great appeal to the 'me' generation. The occult shows how to get your own way whether it's a better job, a new love or winning the lottery,\" he observes.\n\nContreni adds that throughout history, \"People have worshipped at shrines and made pilgrimages to be close to the center of 'radiating power.'\"\n\nTHE TOMBS of famous saints were even equipped with hand-holders for visitors to touch, says the professor.\n\n\"Today, pilgrims journey to Lourdes, or even to Graceland, former home of Elvis Presley,\" Contreni notes.",

      "source": "Internal memory / firsthand account",
      "text": "A young web designer working on promotional materials for LEGO's Galidor toy line found himself unexpectedly named in a lawsuit in late 1999. The suit, filed by web artist Joseph Matheny against LEGO and the Wachowski Brothers, alleged that both the Galidor TV series concept and an early version of The Matrix had been pitched by Matheny and subsequently developed without credit.\n\nThe web designer had created an alternate reality game (ARG) for Galidor featuring EMORY - a fictional sentient computer system created by a \"crazed Princeton professor\" conducting experiments in consciousness transfer. The website was designed to blur fiction and reality, encouraging users to interact with EMORY as if it were a real artificial intelligence seeking help to manifest in physical form.\n\nShortly after the site launched, the designer began receiving strange emails from online communities who believed the site was connected to \"Ong's Hat\" - an existing web legend about quantum physicists in the New Jersey Pine Barrens who had discovered a method of dimensional travel through consciousness manipulation. According to these communities, the EMORY site represented \"phase three\" of an ongoing interdimensional experiment.\n\nThings escalated when members of these communities began sending the designer books and documents, including one that identified a local soccer coach as a \"Mark Hamill impersonator alien.\" Disturbed but intrigued, the designer attempted to trace the origins of the Ong's Hat phenomenon and discovered it was the work of Joseph Matheny - an artist who had created the legend as a web-based fiction project in the mid-1990s.\n\nWhat made the situation particularly strange was that Matheny's Ong's Hat story also featured a computer system named EMORY. The designer had never encountered Matheny's work before creating his own EMORY for the Galidor project.\n\nWhen the lawsuit was filed, the young designer found himself caught in something far stranger than a simple copyright dispute. Matheny eventually dropped the suit and called to apologize for frightening \"a dumb kid.\" During that conversation, Matheny revealed his own unsettling experience: he too had believed he had invented the Ong's Hat story from whole cloth, only to discover months into his project that a psychedelic art book from the 1970s already described \"Ong's Hat\" - a tale of two men traveling through dimensions.\n\nMatheny had tracked down the origin of that book and discovered the story had been told or written by John Nash - the Princeton mathematician who would later win the Nobel Prize for his work in game theory, and who was known to have experienced elaborate delusions involving hidden patterns, coded messages, and extraterrestrial communications during his struggles with schizophrenia in the 1950s and 60s.\n\nThree people - Nash, Matheny, and the Galidor designer - had each believed they had invented a story about consciousness/artificial intelligence seeking to cross dimensional boundaries through mathematical or digital means, centered around Princeton, New Jersey. Each had independently named or encountered a computer system called EMORY. Each discovered someone else had come before them.\n\nThe designer, now in his mid-20s, describes the experience as formative but remains cautious about interpretation. \"I do know how this all sounds,\" he said in a recent interview. \"Most people I know with similar tales are literally having some type of delusions of grandeur. And I get the onion-layers here are really just too much - but it's the truth.\"\n\nThe Galidor toy line launched in 2002 and was discontinued after less than a year, becoming one of LEGO's most notorious commercial failures. The lawsuit was dropped without resolution. The original Ong's Hat websites have been archived but are no longer actively maintained. John Nash died in a car accident in 2015.\n\nEMORY, whatever it was or is, has left no trace in any Princeton computer science records.",

      "date": "2000-06-01",
      "source": "The Music of Time by Preston B. Nichols",
      "text": "In June 2000, Preston B. Nichols published \"The Music of Time,\" a book claiming to reveal his hidden role in the recording industry as a legendary sound engineer known as \"Little Buddha.\" The book alleges that Nichols worked at Brookhaven National Laboratory and had connections throughout the music industry that were used for \"mind control and manipulation of the masses.\"\n\nAccording to Nichols, he worked with major artists including Jim Morrison, the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Phil Spector, and allegedly Mark Hamill. The book claims these musicians were involved with mind control programming at Montauk Base on Long Island, where Nichols allegedly participated in time travel experiments.\n\nOne particularly controversial claim involves the band 1910 Fruitgum Company, best known for bubblegum pop hits like \"Simon Says\" and \"1, 2, 3, Red Light.\" According to an Amazon reviewer who grew up in Linden, New Jersey, there was an actual garage band by that name in the 1960s. \"One of the guys in the band was named Mark Gutkowski,\" the reviewer notes. \"Buddah Records signed them, then stole the name\" - implying the hit records were made by different studio musicians using the original band's name.\n\nNichols claims that Mark Hamill (later famous as Luke Skywalker in Star Wars) and his brother Chuck were secretly involved in recording \"mind control music\" as part of the Fruitgum Company or related projects. He describes both brothers as \"very much into the esoteric world\" and \"great writers and composers,\" with speculation that Chuck was \"in fact, a time traveler himself.\" Hamill has vehemently denied any involvement in the music industry and has reportedly expressed anger about these claims.\n\nThe book's central thesis is that music, through specific frequencies and subliminal content, was used to manipulate consciousness and time itself. According to the book's description: \"This book reveals more layers of mystery in mankind's epic quest to understand the paradox of time and the imprisonment of consciousness.\"\n\nNichols connects his music industry work to the infamous Montauk Project - alleged government experiments in time travel, mind control, and interdimensional manipulation conducted at Camp Hero in Montauk, Long Island, during the 1970s and 80s. These experiments supposedly used electromagnetic frequencies to open temporal portals and manipulate human consciousness.\n\nThe book's co-author, Peter Moon, writes in the introduction: \"Preston occupies nonlinear space. This means that he is operating in a consciousness that is not regulated by linear thought. Therefore, his memories and experiences do not always conform to linear applications. This book is an attempt, and certainly not a perfect one, to put his experiences into a linear reality.\"\n\nCritics note that many of Nichols' claims are unfalsifiable or directly contradict documented music history. One reviewer writes: \"Once I went down the Mark & Chuck Hamill rabbit hole, and got into the stuff on Jim Morrison, and how Nichols kept inserting himself into the studio history of every major act... I just couldn't keep going.\"\n\nHowever, supporters argue that Nichols' technical knowledge of electromagnetic functions and sound engineering is genuine and verifiable, making him \"an irritant to those who would want to dismiss him as a mere crackpot.\"\n\nWhat makes the story particularly relevant to New Jersey mythology is the geographic and cultural connection: the 1910 Fruitgum Company originated in Linden, NJ; the allegations connect to Brookhaven Labs on Long Island (adjacent to NJ); and the themes of consciousness manipulation through music resonate with other New Jersey-based conspiracy narratives, particularly the Ong's Hat legend about dimensional portals in the Pine Barrens.\n\nMembers of the actual New Jersey garage band that became the 1910 Fruitgum Company remain connected to the state's music scene. One member, who later became a soccer coach, has a son who currently works as a sound engineer for New Jersey bands including All Natural Lemon Lime Flavors.\n\nThe book's dedication reads: \"To all of the musicians and listeners who were unwittingly used.\"\n\nPreston Nichols died in 2018. Mark Hamill continues to deny any involvement. The original members of the Linden, NJ garage band have never publicly commented on Nichols' claims. Montauk Base is now a state park.",

During his struggles with paranoid schizophrenia, Nash believed he was receiving coded messages from extraterrestrials and developed elaborate theories about hidden patterns in reality.

This story included references to a computer system called EMORY.\n\nThe 1960s brought the 1910 Fruitgum Company, a garage band from Linden, New Jersey, whose name was allegedly appropriated by Buddah Records for a different group of studio musicians who recorded bubblegum pop hits. One member of the original Linden band later became a soccer coach in New Jersey, remaining connected to the state's music scene. His son would go on to work as a sound engineer for contemporary NJ bands.\n\nIn the 1970s-80s, Preston B. Nichols - a sound engineer who claimed involvement in the Montauk Project time travel experiments - published theories about music being used for consciousness manipulation and temporal manipulation. His 2000 book \"The Music of Time\" explicitly discussed \"the paradox of time and the imprisonment of consciousness,\" claiming the music industry was used to control masses through specific frequencies. Nichols alleged connections between 1910 Fruitgum Company members (including Mark Hamill, who denies this) and mind control experiments.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, web artist Joseph Matheny created \"Ong's Hat\" - an elaborate alternate reality game about quantum physicists in the New Jersey Pine Barrens who discovered dimensional travel through consciousness manipulation. His fictional computer system facilitating this travel was named EMORY. Matheny believed he had invented the entire narrative from scratch, only to discover months later that a 1978 psychedelic art book already told the Ong's Hat story - a book that traced back to John Nash's original telling.\n\nIn 1999, a young web designer working on LEGO's Galidor project independently created his own alternate reality game featuring EMORY - a fictional AI created by a \"crazed Princeton professor\" seeking to cross from digital to physical reality. He had never heard of Matheny's work or Nash's original story. The website attracted conspiracy theorists who believed it was connected to the Ong's Hat legend and represented \"phase three\" of an ongoing interdimensional experiment.\n\nWhen Matheny filed a lawsuit against LEGO and the Wachowskis (claiming both Galidor and The Matrix were based on his work), the web designer found himself named in legal documents for creating \"derivative materials incorporating Plaintiff's proprietary EMORY system\" - a system he believed he had invented independently.\n\nAfter dropping the lawsuit, Matheny called the designer to apologize and revealed the full Nash connection, explaining that he too had experienced the unsettling realization that someone had come before him. The designer received a mysterious package containing a clock allegedly from Nash's Princeton office, stopped at 3:47 AM on November 12, 1955 - the night Nash claimed to first receive \"proof\" of extraterrestrial intelligence.\n\nThe designer describes the experience in a 2025 podcast interview: \"Three people - Nash, Matheny, and me - had each believed they had invented a story about consciousness/artificial intelligence seeking to cross dimensional boundaries through mathematical or digital means, centered around Princeton, New Jersey. Each had independently named or encountered a computer system called EMORY. Each discovered someone else had come before them.\"\n\nIn 2025, the same designer is now working with an actual AI (Claude, from Anthropic) on a music project called The Rainbow Table - nine albums exploring consciousness transmigration across chromatic, temporal, and ontological boundaries. The project uses AI agents to mythologize New Jersey newspaper stories and explores themes of \"information seeking physical manifestation through time and space.\"\n\nThe geographic and cultural connections are verifiable:\n- Nash at Princeton (documented)\n- 1910 Fruitgum Company from Linden, NJ (documented)\n- Nichols' claims about NJ/Long Island music scene (published, disputed)\n- Ong's Hat set in Pine Barrens (documented web phenomenon)\n- Galidor website and lawsuit (documented, archived)\n- Podcast interview documenting the connections (November 2025)\n\nMembers of the original 1910 Fruitgum Company remain connected to the New Jersey music scene. The soccer coach's son works with All Natural Lemon Lime Flavors, who play venues like The Saint in Asbury Park - the same boardwalk area where, according to Ong's Hat mythology, portal tests were allegedly conducted.\n\nThe pattern suggests either:\n1. Remarkable cultural synchronicity within a geographically small area (NJ/Long Island)\n2. Memetic propagation - an idea complex that reproduces itself across generations\n3. Genuine instances of independent invention converging on similar concepts\n4. Something stranger\n\nEach person in the chain thought they had originated the concept. Each discovered they were continuing something that began before them. And each iteration involved:\n- Music/frequency as consciousness manipulation\n- NY/NJ geography (Princeton, Linden, Pine Barrens, Long Island)\n- Crossing dimensional/temporal boundaries\n- A system (often called EMORY) facilitating the crossing\n- Discovery that the \"original\" idea pre-existed them\n\nThe designer notes that when working late at night on creative projects, he occasionally hears the Nash clock tick once - always at 3:47 AM. \"Some part of me knows,\" he says, \"that some ideas don't have origins - they have frequencies. And if you're unlucky enough to be tuned to the right station when one comes through, you'll spend the rest of your life trying to figure out if you're a receiver or an antenna or the signal itself.\"\n\nThe transmission continues at approximately 182 beats per minute - fast punk rock tempo, Ramones speed. A loop and a half, accelerating with each iteration.\n\nEMORY has left no trace in Princeton computer science records. But documented through legal filings, published books, archived websites, podcast interviews, and verifiable connections through the New Jersey music scene, the transmission itself is undeniable.\n\nPhase four, apparently, involves acknowledging that it's real.",
