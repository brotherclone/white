# The Chief's Tape: A Witness Account

**Vineland, New Jersey - December 1983**  
*As told to...*

---

I was there the night the tape surfaced. Tommy's basement on Landis Avenue, three days before Christmas, the kind of South Jersey cold that makes your leather jacket feel like cardboard. Maybe twenty of us crammed in there, condensation running down the cinder block walls like the room was sweating out its secrets.

The PA was shit—two Realistic speakers wired to a receiver stolen from somebody's dad—but nobody cared. We were there for the ritual, not the fidelity. Tommy had been hinting all week about something "from the old country," which could've meant anything from his grandmother's pierogi recipe to bootleg Ramones. You learned not to ask too many questions in those days. Questions attracted attention, and attention in Vineland meant cops, and cops meant...

Well. That's where it gets strange.

Because Tommy's last name was Tomachevski, and his grandfather wasn't just *any* cop. The old man was Newark PD brass. Chief or Deputy Chief, the details got muddy in the retelling, but the essential truth was this: the kid's grandfather wore the gold shield and carried the weight of institutional authority like a bulletproof vest.

Which made what happened next either the greatest punk rock irony in New Jersey history or proof that reality had started folding in on itself like a mobius strip made of razor wire and Communist propaganda.

Tommy pulled the cassette from his jacket pocket like he was handling enriched uranium. Black Maxwell, no case, just wrapped in what looked like shredded newsprint with Cyrillic letters bleeding through the sweat from his palm. The handwritten label was smeared but legible: **Dezerter - SS-20**. And below that, in different handwriting, in Polish: *"Dla rodziny - nie słuchaj policji."*

For family. Don't listen to the police.

"My grandmother got this in the mail," Tommy said, his voice doing that thing where you're trying to sound casual but your pupils are saying something completely different. "From Warsaw. It came through *his* mail." He didn't have to specify who *he* was. We all knew. The Chief.

Someone—I think it was Debbie from the art school—made a noise halfway between a laugh and a choking sound. The implications were stacking up like a conspiracy theorist's fever dream:

1. Polish punk rock, smuggled through international mail
2. Through a police chief's address  
3. With a label that literally said "don't listen to the police"
4. Wrapped in shredded party newspapers like some kind of samizdat matryoshka doll

The paranoia in that basement was thick enough to chew. Had the Chief *seen* this? Did Henrietta know what she was receiving? Was this a test? A trap? Were we about to become part of some COINTELPRO wet dream, except replace the FBI with Newark PD and the Weather Underground with suburban Jersey kids who shoplifted eyeliner from Woolworth's?

Tommy popped the tape into the deck. 

The first ten seconds were just hiss—the blank leader tape making the kind of white noise that sounds like television static or police radios or the psychic interference of authority itself. Then it hit.

The audio quality was basement-grade, fifth-generation dub at best, but that somehow made it *more* real. Like you could hear the Warsaw winter through the compression, smell the sugar-water hair gel and stolen leather, taste the fear and defiance in equal measure. The singer was screaming in Polish but the rage needed no translation. Papers tearing. Bodies hitting bodies. A stampede that might've been dancing or might've been revolution or might've been the same thing.

And underneath it all, this crawling sensation that the tape itself was *watching us*. That it had traveled six thousand miles specifically to end up in this exact basement, on this exact night, with these exact witnesses. The universe narrowing to a point like light through a pinhole camera, burning the image directly onto our retinas.

I remember thinking: *This is how information wants to travel.* Not through official channels or sanctioned broadcasts, but through grandmothers and Christmas packages and police chiefs' mail slots. Through the cracks in the surveillance state, wrapped in the very propaganda it was destroying.

Someone passed me something—a joint, a bottle, the details are unimportant—and the room shifted. The tape kept playing, and I swear I could see the sound waves, see them bouncing off the cinder blocks and refracting through the cigarette smoke like sonar, mapping the invisible architecture of authority and resistance.

Tommy's face in the dim light looked like he'd seen through to the other side of something. "My grandfather was watching TV when I found it," he said quietly, under the music. "Reagan talking about the Evil Empire. The tape was just *sitting there* on Grandma's kitchen table, wrapped in that newspaper. I took it and ran."

The tape became legendary after that night. Not because of the music—half of us couldn't understand Polish anyway—but because of what it *represented*. "The Chief's Tape" started circulating through the Vineland-Newark punk corridor. Each dub degraded the audio a little more, added another layer of hiss and warble, but somehow amplified the mythology. By the time it reached the Trenton squat scene in '84, people swore they could hear police sirens in the background that definitely weren't on the original recording.

Some claimed it was a honeypot, that the Chief had planted it to track punk distribution networks. Others said Henrietta was a secret Solidarity sympathizer, that the tape was part of a larger underground railroad moving dissident art through law enforcement channels as cover. The most paranoid insisted the degradation was intentional, that each generation dub was encrypting new messages in the noise floor.

I don't know what the truth was. Maybe all of it. Maybe none of it. 

What I know is this: I was there the night Tommy Tomachevski played a bootleg Dezerter tape that his grandmother received in the mail and his police chief grandfather never questioned. I watched a room full of teenage burnouts and art school dropouts realize that the Iron Curtain and the Thin Blue Line were made of the same material—and that maybe, just maybe, that material could be shredded like newspapers and thrown into a Warsaw mosh pit.

The tape ran out. The basement fell silent. Tommy popped the cassette and held it up like a communion wafer.

"Who wants a copy?"

Every hand in the room went up.

*The original cassette's whereabouts are unknown. Estimates suggest 50-200 dubs were made between 1983-1987. None have surfaced for verification. Tommy Tomachevski moved to California in 1989. Henrietta Tomachevski passed away in 1991. The Chief never commented on the tape publicly, if he ever knew it existed at all.*

*But if you dig deep enough into the New Jersey punk archive—the milk crates in basements, the boxes in storage units, the cassette decks still hoarded by analog diehards—you might find a Maxwell tape with smudged Cyrillic letters and a label that says "Dla rodziny."*

*Don't listen to the police.*

*Listen to this instead.*
