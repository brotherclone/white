      "text": "JACKSON TOWNSHIP \u2014 At least eight persons perished and eight were injured when a fire swept through the Haunted Castle attraction at Six Flags' Great Adventure amusement park last night.\n\nAll were visitors to the 500-acre amusement park and were believed to be teenagers, said Township Committeeman Richard Berry.\n\n\"Eight are known to have died and eight perished in the fire,\" Township Police Capt. Samuel DePasquale said. \"The fire spread so quickly because of the wind that apparently the victims had no time to escape.\"\n\nThe dead, burned beyond recognition, all were visitors to the 500-acre amusement park and were believed to be teenagers.\n\nAuthorities said they had to wait more than an hour while the rubble cooled before they could start picking through the debris.\n\n\"Initially, we thought they were mannequins, but then we knew something was wrong,\" Turnbach said.\n\n\"When I arrived,\" Assistant Fire Chief Samuel DePasquale said, \"the fire was engulfing the structure.\"\n\nWitnesses said the fire began about 6:35 p.m. and flames went as high as the trees. There was little billowing smoke \u2014 it was just a massive wall of flames, one witness said. \"It looked like a war zone.\"\n\nPark's visitors hear screams as flames soar, smoke billows\n\nJACKSON TOWNSHIP \u2014 Visitors to Six Flags' Great Adventure reported seeing \"big billows of smoke\" and \"flames as high as the trees\" as they realized something terrible was happening last night, and watched.\n\nOne of the photographers, John Fischetti, said he didn't see any panic among the patrons, \"just business as usual.\" Tom Flynn was walking toward Skeeball games. He said most people passing the Haunted Castle attraction as the fire started about 6:35 p.m. didn't see smoke until it was really bellowing out. The whole roof of the castle was covered with soot, said Joy Flynn, of Jackson Township.\n\n\"We were coming into the park, the whole sky lit up,\" said Mike Freeman, when the fire started. \"Even though we were about a mile away, we thought it was really bad. Smoke was billowing up into the air and everybody was still coming out of the park, and still others apparently entered to see what was going on.\"\n\nEventually, park officials decided to close the park and a stream of people was lined up on Route 537 to get out.\n\nPaul Bayer, Ocean County emergency management coordinator and chief of the Lakehurst Fire Co. for Ocean County Emergency Services, said the fire was brought under control \u2014 \"whatever that means\" \u2014 when he arrived.\n\n\"At 6:44 (the dead) would have to be identified through dental records,\" Turnbach said. \"But I know they were gathered together in one trailer, on a lit-up highway with everyone very upset.\"\n\nIn addition, an emotional woman gathered together with many people (as the park closed) handed out phone numbers and told a reporter that something traumatic had happened. They were very upset.\n\nTurnbach said it would take about a day or two to figure out who the victims were.\n\n\"A fairly thorough search was done,\" Bayer said. \"...I was shocked. Most of the victims were huddled together where there was nothing left to see that there was something there \u2014 an entrance or an exit, or smoke inhalation, trauma or all of the above.\"\n\nSome firefighters were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation, the Ocean County prosecutor's office said.",

      "text": "A 17-year-old Woodbridge boy was put on two-years' probation yesterday for desecrating a Roman Catholic church in Perth Amboy by spray painting Satanic symbols on the building and sidewalk.\n\nErnest J. Hennessy of Florida Grove Road in the Keasbey section of the township was sentenced by Superior Court Judge Richard S. Rebeck.\n\nRebeck also suspended Hennessy's one-year term in the New Jersey Training School for Boys and Girls in Monroe and ordered him to pay $600 toward cleaning up the spray-painted areas.\n\nAssistant Middlesex County Prosecutor Ernest Bergman had asked for a custodial sentence against Hennessy.\n\nPerth Amboy police arrested Hennessy on Jan. 10 outside Holy Spirit Church at Brace and Hazel avenues, four days after the church was marred by reddish paint sprayed on the columns.\n\nMiddlesex County Prosecutor Alan A. Rockoff, who announced Hennessy's arrest, said the youth marked the church with symbols of Satan \u2014 an upsidedown cross, \"666\" and the slogan, \"Satan Lives.\"\n\n\"Slayer,\" the name of a heavy metal rock group, was also sprayed on the church. Rockoff described Hennessy was a \"devoted follower\" of the group.\n\nPerth Amboy detectives were staking out the church on the night of Jan. 6-7 when Hennessy approached and began comparing the structure with photographs of the desecration from The News Tribune, a Woodbridge newspaper.\n\nPolice officers said Hennessy's jacket, sneakers and cap were stained with paint that matched paint found on the church.\n\nHennessy, who was 16 at the time of the offense, admitted a charge of criminal mischief \u2014 the actual spray painting. But he pleaded innocent and was tried for violating the state law against placing hate symbols or phrases on houses of worship.\n\nBergman said the judge also found Hennessy guilty of the latter offense.\n\nHennessy testified that he was neither motivated by satanism or heavy metal rock music. The defendant insisted he was simply intoxicated.\n\nJudge Rebeck also cleared Hennessy of a third offense \u2014 criminal mischief for toppling and damaging a $10,000 one-ton Italian-sculpted statue, \"Our Lady of the Rosary,\" on Dec. 13, 1985.",

      "text": "Continued from Page A1\n\nFleck, his school principal, \"died with Tom.\"\n\nYears before anyone jumped into the Satanism stuff as an explanation they should have looked at other possible causes, said Jerome Travers, a child psychologist for the former Catholic priest who has studied religious delusions.\n\n\"It's not a book that he read that caused him to kill his parents,\" Travers said, referring to three books on witchcraft in the boy checked out of the township library six days before the murder-suicide. \"It is what was going on inside him that caused it.\"\n\nTravers, who never met Tom but who has been following the case, said the boy had just experienced the first break with his parents sometime including religious delusions. Tom may have been in a severe family conflict that triggered the boy's rage. It appears Tom Sullivan Jr. died confused, angry and in turmoil, rebelling not only against his parents but against their conventions. It also appears the quiet 14-year-old was headed for trouble long before he showed any interest in Satanism. Interviews with neighbors and parents of the near-perfect child, \"the kind of boy you'd like for a son,\" as one neighbor described him, fit the normal life in the town.\n\nA gifted student, Tom earned a wrestling scholarship and from newspapers year-round to earn money. He was involved in sports, wrestling in a wrestling program and faithfully practiced matches. As a student he stood 5 feet, 7 inches tall, and he was strong. He worked out with weights in his bedroom to build his strength even more. He would sometimes sleep in his sweats, run five miles and force himself to run before matches to make weight, according to Nicholas, a school friend.\n\nHis principal described him as an average wrestler. Tom told a friend he planned to go to college on a wrestling scholarship. Young parents were, according to others, very happy with their son's success in their children's lives. Thomas Sullivan Sr., a hospital equipment salesman, worked with Tom at wrestling, and his mother told a neighbor she would even fake sick just to spend time with her son.\n\nTom's mother wanted him to get a job outside the house because she wanted to spend time with her son. \"They were a very close family,\" a neighbor, Dr. Alvin Stern, said.\n\nTom's days were full and carefully structured by his parents, police say. He followed the paper route in the morning, study time after school and wrestling meet nights. The boy had little free time, according to Police Chief Casper Stamer.\n\nBut in his unique free time, friends say, Tom slipped off the path he was on. Friends first noticed Tom's demeanor, his manner, had changed during the fall and definitely into the winter few of the adults who knew him would have suspected.\n\nHe began experimenting with alcohol in the fifth grade, said friends who drank with him and he puzzled liquor from his parents, he bragged of cheating on tests at school and would, the friends said, frequently drink in the bathroom.\n\nOnce he got caught, he said a friend whose name he wouldn't give, said he smoked marijuana and bragged about it before his friends said, frequently in the bathroom.\n\nTom's highly publicized interest in Satanism, which peaked just before the suicide to three books he checked out from the Fair Oaks Branch Library in Summit, apparently did not start that interest.\n\nHe began his studies shortly before his death at the Fair Oaks Branch Library. \"We visited several homes where Tom was visiting on Christmas vacation. He would come straight home from school to the living room of the small Cape Cod house and sit in a fire in the couch. His wife and son were not there. He looked depressed and was just staring down the driveway.\"\n\nNot long after, sometime before Christmas, Tom had an argument with his mother in which he cursed at her from his hands about 10 p.m. \u2014 Tom muttered words like his mother in words about it from Christmas vacation. His mother apparently was preparing for bed. She screamed him in the basement. She got a teen-slasher movie \"Friday the 13th\" was in the VCR, but nobody was watching it.\n\nPolice said there was no evidence of a struggle in any parts of the house where they lived. His mother said to each other, but the meeting is still under death.\n\nShe died on the floor near the family computer and her son was found a 6 feet away. She was stabbed more than a dozen times in the neck, back, and shoulders by a kitchen knife.\n\nTom left the basement, washed up and changed, then shot himself in a note he left that, police say, contained his mother's initial and a note inside that a short time after the murder he describes his mother's suicide type.\n\nThe note had no other text other than to say it indicated the killings were a mistake and they would kill him the day after the murder to describe his mother's suicide.\n\nThe boy probably felt trapped, Stamer theorizes, because the fact that Tom decided to kill himself.\n\n\"Looking back on it,\" Tom's classmates believe their friend changed so much the last days they said they knew about it. He wasn't his mother was no longer the one they knew. \"He wasn't like a classmate,\" Pfarr said in a statement. \"He was still a kind of person to do that to his mother,\" she'd play and a classmate, \"He was still nice.\"\n\nNick Ryder, another classmate, said he'd still be alive.\n\nSaid Michael's view, he'd still be alive.",

He teaches guitar, does some recording and crafts his own electric guitar known as the \"Barth Vader.\"\n\n\"It was Star Wars time,\" he says with a grin of embarrassment over the guitar's christening, but also with resignation.\n\nAt 34, Barth has been making guitars since 1976. He prefers hard woods \u2014 black walnut, ash, basswood \u2014 to craft the instruments. A Dover High School graduate, Barth says he's never had any formal instruction in guitar making. Instead, he learned the art the way mechanics learn their trade \u2014 by taking a guitar apart and putting it back together again.\n\n\"I started with repair work,\" he says. \"I saw how they made guitars for the industry and began figuring out how to make them better. Besides, there aren't too many schools to learn how to do it.\"\n\nHis last custom guitar devoured between 40 and 60 hours, he says, and cost about $1,000. He routs out the bodies on his band saw, glues the various parts together, sands them and then adds the electronics.\n\n\"I only know enough about electronics to assemble the parts,\" he says modestly. But his \"Barth Vader\" is somewhat unique in that he adds what he calls a graphic equalizer which allows the musician six tone controls.\n\nTeaching, repairing and band crafting, however, are only done to permit him to continue his true love \u2014 performing in a rock n' roll band known as \"Rocking New Jersey\" whose schedule includes local night clubs, private parties and weddings.\n\nThe name of the band can perhaps be linked to one of his favorite performers, Bruce Springsteen, who Barth claims has been one of the best influences in not only rock music, but its culture.\n\n\"It's a good, clean thing,\" he says. \"It's not violent, not stoney.\"\n\nWhile Barth isn't \"laughing all the way to the bank,\" as he puts it, he is doing what he wants to do, even if it means only a modicum of free time.\n\n\"It does get harder as the years go by,\" he admits, \"but I love it and the only reason I'm doing all this is to be able to get out and perform.\"",

      "text": "YOU HAVE just been attacked. Bruised and terrified, you make your way to police headquarters where you are asked to provide a description of your assailant \u2014 and suddenly discover that you can't remember any of the details of the attack.\n\nForensic hypnosis could help you recall the incident and put police on the trail of possible suspects.\n\nAlthough it is not a new technique, forensic hypnosis only recently has begun to gain acceptance by law enforcement officials as a way to gather information and help victims, witnesses and even suspects recall details of a crime.\n\nThe technique has been used to provide information in cases of homicide, rape, arson, burglary, robbery and assault, according to Peter E. Stoessler, a hypnosis consultant and director of the Siegfried Hypnosis Center in East Brunswick Township.\n\nStoessler and ANY of former State Trooper Francis M. Trammell, a hypnosis instructor for The Family YMCA of Ocean County, Lakewood, are organizing a course in forensic hypnosis to be offered to police departments and officers.\n\nTrammell said he suggested the course after he was approached by two Lakewood officers interested in learning the technique.\n\nHypnosis was used several years ago in a case involving a hit-and-run death in Lakewood.\n\nIn November 1974, Rabbi Jacob Katz of Lakewood was hit and killed at the intersections of New Hampshire and County Line roads as he was trying to cross Route 9.\n\nThe hit-and-run suspect approached police as they were aiding the rabbi, then said he had to get his license and registration and returned to his car. When police looked for him minutes later, the man had disappeared.\n\nUnder hypnosis, a patrolman recalled the license plate number of a car believed to have struck the rabbi.\n\nA police investigation using the license plate number led to the arrest of a suspect about two weeks later in connection with the death.\n\n\"THE FACT that he remembered the license number is not the evidence \u2014 from that point it was up to the police to prove that that was the car (that struck the rabbi),\" Stoessler said.\n\n\"It (hypnosis) can be used to protect ... but it is never used to gain a confession or a conviction,\" he said.\n\nStoessler, who will teach the course for police officers with Trammell assisting, hopes that at least 10 officers and students.\n\nThe course is expected to be taught at the hypnosis center in East Brunswick. Stoessler said. He and all officers or departments who wish to take the course can contact him at the center or Trammell at the YMCA.\n\nIn addition to law enforcement officials, psychologists and lawyers have used forensic hypnosis to obtain additional information in a case. As a general witness or relax a client prior to taking a lie detector test, Stoessler said.\n\nContrary to the popular conception of hypnosis, he said, and individual is not asleep and is not controlled by the hypnotist. A hypnotic state is not a sleep and is not being controlled by the will.\n\nANYONE CAN hypnotized to varying degrees, provided the subject consents to hypnosis and does not resist, Trammell said.\n\nA person under hypnosis may lose some sense of time, but will remember all or portions of the session and can be brought back to full consciousness at any time.\n\nNew Jersey has no law governing the use of forensic hypnosis to ensure that the information obtained will be admissible as evidence by the courts, Stoessler said.\n\nSESSIONS SHOULD be videotaped whenever possible, or at least tape recorded, he said.\n\nVideotapes are preferred because they prove that sections of tape have not been spliced and provide a visible record of the hypnotist, client, law enforcement officials and lawyers present, Stoessler said.\n\nThe manner in which the hypnosis session is conducted must ensure court scrutiny, he noted.\n\n\"If (the courts determine) you're leading the witness, the information is automatically thrown out as evidence because the questions might have put words in their mouth,\" he said.\n\nOnly certain questions can be asked to avoid producing \"leading\" or \"pseudo-memories,\" he said.\n\nPseudo-memories may result when a hypnotist asks \"leading\" questions. In such cases the subject may \"recall\" something that never actually happened, he said.\n\nIF THE VICTIM then recalls a hand with a scar, a set ring or some other specific information, the hypnotist can proceed to question the victim about those specific recollections.\n\nFor example, an assault victim remember a hand grabbed you, describe his hands or any part of his body you can remember, he suggested.\n\n\"A good question to ask would be, 'As the assailant grabbed you, describe his hands or any part of his body you can see,'\" Stoessler said.\n\nStudents also will learn the legal aspects and characteristics or events that are applicable to ensure that the information obtained will be accepted as evidence by the courts.\n\nParticipants in the six-week courses at the center will be trained in applying hypnosis. The forensic aspects and taught to apply these techniques to questioning and working with witnesses, victims or suspects.\n\n\"Hypnosis is always used to give you the lead \u2014 the missing link \u2014 but you need more information to go on,\" he said.\n\nFurther police investigation is necessary before any arrest can be used as evidence in making arrests, he said.\n\n\"All sorts of emotional factors play a role in hypnosis, and the hypnotist has to be aware of this and phrase his questions accordingly,\" he noted.\n\nA system of ethics for revenge could be under hypnosis and deliberately accuse an innocent of a crime, he explained.\n\nINFORMATION OBTAINED through hypnosis is not sufficient for police to immediately arrest anyone, Stoessler emphasized.\n\nA Los Angeles police survey of 878 cases involving hypnosis from 1975 to April 1979 showed that new information obtained through hypnosis was utilized in 80.2 percent of the 126 cases solved.\n\n\"Hypnosis is always used to give you the lead \u2014 the missing link \u2014 but you need more information to go on,\" he said.",

      "text": "CLIFTON (AP) \u2014 A 17-year-old strangled as he sat praying in his father's car was the target of an earlier death plots by five teen-agers who met in weekly planning sessions since November, authorities said yesterday.\n\nRobert Solimine Jr. of North Haledon was throttled with an extension cord by a 17-year-old acquaintance sitting behind him in the back seat and proceeded to strangle him as they prayed a \"Hail Mary,\" Passaic County Prosecutor Ronald Fava said.\n\n\"When they got to the line, 'Now and at the hour of death,' he flipped his cord around his seat and proceeded to strangle Mr. Solimine,\" Fava said.\n\nSolimine's body was found in the car at 12:30 a.m. Monday morning in a school parking lot. The killing happened sometime after 11 p.m. Sunday night.\n\nTwo 17-year-olds, two 14-year-olds and Frank Castaldo, 18, are accused of murder. All are from Clifton. Names of the juveniles were not released by authorities.\n\nCastaldo was not present at the time of the killing, but the youths met with him before it and afterward, Fava said.\n\nThe 17-year-old alleged killer bought religious medals with an image of St. Joseph and the infant Jesus for the members of the group as a symbol of solidarity, Fava said.\n\nAuthorities are puzzled about the motive.\n\n\"There is no reason that rises to the level of what a reasonable, rational person would consider a motive for murder. There was some indication (Solimine) wasn't their favorite person, that he was considered something of a pest.\n\n\"But those are reasons not to invite someone to your birthday party; they do not rise to level of wanting to kill someone,\" he said.\n\nFava said the group began in November at Castaldo's home to plan to harm Solimine. They first considered vandalism, such as slashing tires, then escalated to planning physical harm and then murder, Fava said.\n\n\"At some of these meetings, they would begin with readings from the Bible,\" Fava said.\n\nTwo earlier death plots failed. In the first attempt in January, the group planned to force an aerosol can into Solimine's gas tank, thinking it would heat up and explode as he drove the car, Fava said. They were unable to force the can down the gas pipe, and if they had, gas tanks do not get hot, Fava said.\n\nOn Saturday, the night before the murder, the group planned to trick Solimine into handcuffing himself to his steering wheel, then they would set fire to the car, Fava said.\n\n\"They were going explain they were some kind of trick handcuffs, and see how long it would take him to get out. He apparently was suspicious enough to decline to be handcuffed,\" Fava said.\n\nFava said Castaldo appeared to be the group's leader.\n\n\"The 18-year-old appears to have had some control over the group. He ran the meetings,\" he said. \"He had approval or veto power over plans.\"\n\nEarly Tuesday, charges had only been filed against the 17-year-old accused of actually strangling Solimine and a 14-year-old who was in the car with him.",

Timestamp burn-in shows 8:47 PM - 10:00 PM. Audio has that compressed VHS quality where whispers are too loud and normal speech distorts. The leader, Frank Castaldo, keeps saying \"from the top\" and \"let's try that again with more conviction.\" The tape ends mid-sentence. It's been circulating through extreme cinema collector circles since 2003 as \"The Clifton Rehearsal Tape\" - more disturbing for its theatrical banality than its content. They workshop homicide with the same earnest energy as a high school production of Our Town. Nobody knows who was holding the camera.",

The largest shard - eight inches long, still bearing dancing bear blotter residue - was kept by Emily for fifteen years in a shoebox under her bed. In 1997, after receiving cryptic letters from the psychiatric facility where Lisa had been institutionalized, Emily ground and shaped the glass into a blade following diagrams Lisa had drawn. The letters spoke of \"cutting a new door\" - staff dismissed this as psychotic rambling, but Emily understood. She wrapped the knife in original dancing bear blotter paper, hid it inside a hollowed-out Bible, and smuggled it into the facility during visiting hours. Three days later, Lisa vanished from her locked room. No blood. No broken windows. No body ever found. Just an empty bed and the faint smell of ozone. The knife was never recovered. Emily Chen disappeared six months later, leaving only a note: \"I helped her cut the door. Now I'm going through.\"",

      "text": "MORRIS PLAINS \u2014 The problem, the slight, gray-haired man was saying, is that we have become too \"beta-bound.\"\n\nWith the help of an electronic tracking device, Jose Silva, founder of Silva Mind Control, the method to \"help you become more humane,\" was sinking into alpha.\n\nThe silence became more pronounced in the room as the beeps indicating beta or conscious mental activity slowed down deeper into the subconscious regions of alpha.\n\nThen, with rapid hand and wrist flexes, Silva surfaced again and opened his eyes to the world of beta.\n\nIn town this weekend to help promote the method through a new graduate course, Silva visited the Mind Control bookstore named after him at 1012 Mount Tabor Road.\n\nMind control, Silva said, to the small audience of observers seated in the training room adjoining the bookstore, is a \"method of mental training which helps human beings use the subconscious consciously.\"\n\nHe speaks softly, this man who has triggered a movement with more than half a million devotees worldwide. The promises of what mind control yields are almost as numerous as the numbers of individuals who join the introductory $175 course.\n\nNew jobs, better education, improved relationships \u2014 the list is endless. Because as \"persons become healthier, more productive, they become problem-solvers,\" Silva says.\n\n\"We're using another dimension of the brain,\" he explained. And there are no limitations, in his opinion, to the power of that facility. \"You become more developed. It's like,\" he says, straining to relate to the uninitiated, \"using two tool boxes to do the job instead of one.\"\n\nSilva's own interest in psychology was triggered during some testing he was in the Army in 1944. \"I wondered what that man was doing to me,\" he remembers. Later as an electronic engineer, Silva, a Mexican-American who began with three years of formal education, became interested in knowing \"if we could arrest frequency.\"\n\nHe likened the brain to a transmitter-receiver unit. \"When impedance equals zero,\" he discovered, \"there is minimal opposition to resistance and the greater use of electrical energy. Then,\" he beams, \"you've reached resonance.\"\n\nIn other words, you're there. \"In synchronization, in step, and not wasting energy,\" according to mind control principle. You've reached alpha \u2014 sleeping consciousness one step beyond the limits of conscious beta \u2014 the \"resonant point\" in the brain.\n\nBy 1966, Silva and several groups had experimented with several groups of people in his native Texas. He began to branch out in 1970, and barely five years later mind control is an accredited course in some high schools, with several universities due to follow suit.\n\n\"The reason for success is a simple one for Silva. \"You change your way of thinking,\" he claims. \"You just don't want to use other people. You cannot think evil at alpha. If you did, you would get bounced back to beta.\"\n\nFor a brave new world is the ultimate goal of mind control. Silva himself will admit his \"ultimate goal\" is to have \"everyone\" learn mind control.\n\nThere are tests under way now analyzing whether children \"inherit\" the mind control principle from parents who demonstrate that principle in their lives.\n\nThus, he enthuses, mind control is \"the first step of the second phase of human evolution of the planet. The world will become a better place, in short.\n\nThere are many questions yet unanswered Silva will admit to. \"Mind control is a hypersensitive means of perceiving information the means of which we don't yet understand fully.\" Present tests also have gotten \"interesting feedback\" from a force Silva conceptualizes as the \"center of the galaxy.\"\n\n\"We have reason to believe,\" he says, smiling, \"the results have been so promising, that there's something there.\"\n\nBecause, after all, \"alpha is the direction we came from.\"",

      "source": "Vineland Times Journal",
      "text": "WARSAW, Poland (AP) - As a crowd of young punks brawled on the dance floor, the lead singer for Dezerter - the deserter - screamed out an anthem to what he called Poland's \"miscarried generation: No goals, no future, no hope, no joy.\"\n\nThe singer hurled stacks of government and Communist Party newspapers into the crowd of 200, while shrieking the word \"propaganda.\" The title of the song was \"News.\"\n\nThe teen-agers shredded the papers, and lunged at each other with fists, feet, legs, and bodies in a desperate frenzy which resembled a fight more than a dance.\n\nThe Polish punk rock movement is small - several thousand, according to long-time observers of the Polish musical scene - and typifies the lag in popular culture between Western and Eastern Europe. But it reflects the disorientation of many Polish youth.\n\n\"I like punk because it's the only music which lets us get our aggression out,\" said one 18-year-old boy, wearing a studded leather jacket and cropped blond hair that he stood on end by donating in sugar-saturated water.\n\n\"If Solidarity is said to find in Poland, where clothes of all kinds are scarce, he said, grinning, 'but we steal them.'\"\n\nWhile looking to the West for musical and other cultural values, Polish teen-agers feel themselves firmly in the political grip of the Soviet bloc.\n\nPoland's communist authorities barely tolerate punk but see it as a \"safety valve\" for the nation's disaffected youth, according to one sociologist.\n\nRecent times have been confusing for Polish teen-agers, who first lived through the heady upheaval led by the now-outlawed Solidarity labor federation, then endured 18 months of martial law.\n\nNow they face an economic crisis which many say will confine them to frustrating jobs and deny them a house of their own until they reach middle age.\n\n\"Why were if you have to wait 20 years for an apartment?\" asks 16-year-old Rikardai, lead singer for Dezerter and a vocation school drop-out who refuses to give his real name.\n\nJerry Kordowicz, a disc-jockey for state-run Polish radio, said in a recent interview that \"Polish punk is a social phenomenon rather than a musical one. It is the spontaneous protest of a generation, not only in political matters but in cultural ones as well.\"\n\nState radio which regularly features Western rock bands, rarely broadcasts Polish punk, Kordowicz says, because \"the lyrics of punk songs don't deserve to be played over the radio.\"\n\nIts aim of radio is to popularize certain cultural values,\" he said.\n\nGovernment censorship blocks most Polish punk from the airwaves, and bans some songs from concert. Last year Dezerter was called SS-20, after the new generation of Soviet nuclear missiles, but dropped the name after authorities refused to print a poster for the group. The group renamed itself Dezerter - a controversy name in martial law Poland.\n\nAnother rock band, Perfect, came under government harassment when it began replacing the line \"We want to be ourselves\" in one song with \"We want to beat ZOMO,\" a reference to Poland's riot police.\n\nAnother Perfect lyric, \"Don't be afraid of anyone,\" became, in concerts, \"Don't be afraid of Jaruzelski,\" a jab at Poland's leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski. It also upset authorities.\n\nPunk groups have also been banned from giving concerts from time to time - such was the case during Pope John Paul II's visit to his homeland in June.\n\n\"Punk here is just like anywhere in the world,\" says Dezerter manager Tomasz Wisniewski. \"Punks here don't respect the authorities, but playing punk here is more difficult, because of the censorship and hard to get instruments,\" says Kordowicz. For the most part, only those bands that cross the line from punk to music with more popular appeal have recorded albums by the state recording monopoly, he said.\n\nMost of the 100 or so new wave bands are amateurs, according to Kordowicz.",

Smalley is being held in Cumberland County Jail in lieu of $1,000 bail.\n\nArrested at the Vineland State School where she works was Florida Mary Nocco, 26, also of the Howard Street home, whose father, William, heads the CETA program here. Miss Nocco was charged as a disorderly person for allegedly removing the proper label from the original container of a prescription drug she was issued a summons and released.\n\nAlso arrested was William Kenneth Herring, 28, of the Howard Street address. Herring was charged with possession of a controlled dangerous substance (over 25 grams) with intent to distribute. He was freed on $10,000 bail.\n\nThe second raid took place at 12:05 a.m. when five police officers armed with a search warrant to the second floor apartment of Cliff Smalley and Kenneth Dickenson, no given. Police said Smalley, who opened the door, said at the time he didn't know where Dickenson was wherabouts.\n\nInside the apartment, police allegedly found five fish tanks with \"magic mushrooms\" growing inside them had been placed in the tanks in order to grow the psilocybin mushrooms, police said.\n\nAccording to police, other drug-related paraphernalia was uncovered in the kitchen and bathroom. Police also allegedly found a small amount of marijuana (under 25 grams).\n\nSmalley has a charge against whom charges are pending, allegedly (Continued on Page 44)",

Warth, president of the Society for the Investigation of the Unexplained.\n\nThe group, which Warth claims has \"thousands\" of members across the globe, investigates everything from lights in the sky to household ghosts in a quest to provide scientific facts about things most of us consider science fiction.\n\n\"We're interested in just about all unexplained phenomena. We try to keep up with everything and report to our members,\" Warth said.\n\nA recent edition of the organization's quarterly journal, \"Pursuit,\" is filled with articles providing scholarly updates on such topics as possible methods of UFO propulsion, the sighting of a food-tail lizard man in South Carolina and references to werewolves in Shakespeare's plays.\n\nWhile group members claim there is more than a germ of truth in most tales of the unexplained, Warth said the organization doesn't try to force its views on unbelievers.\n\n\"We don't take any stands on ed skepticism,\" Warth said. \"If someone is interested in the unexplained we only ask them to read both sides, do their own research and think.\"\n\nBut Warth is a true believer. He counts psychic speller Uri Geller among his close friends, and claims another psychic friend healed his wife who suffered a kidney ailment.\n\nHe claims to have seen UFOs and believes almost everyone has some untapped psychic ability.\n\n\"One of the biggest problems we have as human beings is that we are very limited by our vision. We don't believe in something unless we can see it,\" he said.\n\n\"Pursuit\" is published from a spare bedroom on the second-floor of Warth's Victorian home in Monmouth County.\n\nThe house is also home to Warth's many cats and his wife's collection of antique clocks, both of which add a gothic atmosphere to the premises.\n\nA devotee of the unexplained from an early age, the 57-year-old man has been president of the society since 1975.\n\nIn addition to editing the magazine, Warth's duties as president involve taking phone calls from people who have suddenly had an encounter with the unknown.\n\n\"When we get a call, I'll screen the people to make sure they aren't part of the lunatic fringe. If it's a significant incident, we'll go to the site and investigate,\" said Warth, a professional chemist who receives no salary from the society.\n\nWhile screening calls, Warth keeps in mind that most people aren't accustomed to having dealings with the supernatural.\n\n\"Seeing a ghost for the first time can be pretty unnerving,\" he said matter-of-factly.\n\nWhen visiting a house suspected of being haunted, Warth brings along a psychic who can tell if there is a spiritual presence nearby. Warth also asks the homeowner to write down as much information as possible about the sighting and the history of the problem.\n\n\"People worry that having a ghost will lower their property values,\" Warth explained.\n\n\"The society can also provide assistance with the problem. Help, in most cases, usually involves gently informing the ghost that it is, in fact, dead, Warth said.\n\n\"A ghost basically feels they are still alive. They can't understand why there are strange people in their house. They don't like the changes that are being made so they annoy the residents,\" Warth said. A one-year membership in the society is $30 and includes a subscription to \"Pursuit.\"\n\nAnyone interested in joining should write: SITU URSUIT, P.O. Box 265, Little Silver, N.J. 07739-0265.",

Oklahoma investigators saved a few satanic drawings and writings by a boy who had killed his parents; relatives threw away the rest.\n\nThey know better now.\n\nPolice, parents, teachers and clergy have learned some tough lessons about hard-to-believe phenomenon as dark as it is complex. Violence and crime among teen-agers caught up in the occult, particularly a self-styled Satanism laced with drugs, savage rock music and a mish-mash of symbols and rituals, have adults talking seriously about the unspeakable.\n\n\"Three years ago, nobody wanted to hear it, nobody wanted to believe it was real,\" said San Francisco police Det. Sandi Gallant, who recently received four calls a day from around the country on crimes with satanic or occult overtones. \"Now I'm seeing them tuning into it, looking to see if it's a reality and finding it does exist.\"\n\nAuthorities around the country are seeing a rise of violence and crime among teen-agers caught up in the occult, particularly a self-styled Satanism laced with drugs, savage rock music and a mish-mash of symbols and rituals.\n\n\"The paranoid fantasy is becoming a major social problem,\" said Carl Raschke, director of the Institute of Humanities at the University of Denver. \"If you're looking for it, you don't see the evidence. But when you're looking for it, you see it everywhere.\"\n\nIn one month this winter, three Missouri teen-agers were charged with first-degree murder in the death of a classmate beaten with baseball bats and dumped into a cistern. A popular 15-year-old put a rifle to her head in Vermont. A New Jersey eighth-grader fatally stabbed his mother with a Boy Scout knife, then slit his throat and wrists.\n\n\"The kids will tell you themselves: 'What have we got to live for?' You've crammed religion down our throats. You've destroyed everything. You've built bombs that can wipe out the world. So we live for today,'\" said Denver police Det. Bill Wickersham. \"That's what Satanism says \u2014 'Do what thou wilt.' \"\n\nAt Chicago-based Cult Awareness Network, every month brings news of a teen-ager involved in crime believed to be linked to devil worship. At least 10 percent of the 250 calls they receive each month are about satanic cults, a significant rise from previous years, said Cynthia Kisser, the group's executive director. \"I believe we're only getting the tip of the iceberg,\" said San Francisco's Gallant.\n\n\"I suspect we're only getting the tip of the iceberg,\" San Francisco's Gallant said. \"I believe for every one we're hearing about, there are five we haven't picked up on.\"\n\nIt's easy to see why. Thomas Carl Sullivan Jr., 14, a paperboy appeared to be a model son and student until a month before he killed his mother, Betty Ann, and himself. Michael Kimball, 15, before she put a bullet through her brain, was considered a giving, loving child who brought light into others' lives. James Hardy, one of three 17-year-olds charged in the beating death, was a senior and athlete at St. Thomas the Apostle High School in Kansas City.\n\nSatanism, which revels in evil, destruction, instant gratification and ritual guaranteed to shock parents, offers the ultimate rebellion.\n\n\"It's a shortcut to power, and the only thing you have to do is stick your neck out. There's this element of danger,\" said Linda Blood, a former member of the Temple of Set, a group of traditional Satanists.\n\n\"It's like the occult version of The Revenge of the Nerds.\" Are kids involved in self-styled Satanism \u2014 separated from the traditional religious Satanists, who are public about their beliefs and disapprove of criminal activity, and adult devil cults, which some observers believe use drugs and blackmail to lure desperate teenagers into drug-related crimes \u2014 seeking rebellion into the realm of the bizarre.\n\nSuffice it, for example, became \"Malakas,\" adopting some of the outward trappings: black clothing, inverted crosses, encircled pentagrams, goat heads or the number 666 worn as jewelry or drawn on notebooks.\n\nSome rob graveyards to get what they need.\n\nDrugs play a major role, especially amphetamines, PCP and hallucinogens such as acid. Satanism and drugs were the glue for the Purple Knights, a gang of Denver-area teen-agers, some as young as 12, involved in burglaries, suicide attempts, auto theft and arson.\n\nPlease see 'Satanism, page 2",

E. Etzel, a spokesman at state police headquarters in Trenton, said only three of those arrested in the Saturday night melee after the concert by Iron Maiden and Waysted were juveniles. Two cars were overturned and set afire before the arrests.\n\n\"Don't call them kids,\" Etzel said. \"For the most part these were adults age 18 or over.\"\n\nThe charges against the 33 included aggravated assault with a motor vehicle, simple assault, trespassing, criminal mischief and creating a disturbance, said State police Sgt. Robert Martin.\n\nEtzel said a state trooper suffered minor injuries during the fracas and that no one else was hurt.\n\nPaul Wolcott, a spokesman for the operators of the Meadowlands, said it was his understanding that the group was much smaller and that there were 15 to 20 arrests of people refusing to leave and some motor vehicle summonses. Wolcott, who works for the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, said he also believed that only one car was either set on fire or caught fire.\n\nRobert E. Mulcahy 3rd, the chief executive officer of the sports complex, said Sunday night that the authority would take action regarding future heavy metal concerts, if necessary.\n\n\"If the reports from our own security people and the state police lead me to conclude that this policy (of having heavy metal concerts at the Meadowlands) should be revised, I am prepared to make such a recommendation to the board,\" Mulcahy said in a statement.",

No member of Black Vomit does drugs. We do not now and never have advocated drug use. In fact, several of our songs are against drug and alcohol use and/or abuse. Associating Black Vomit with drugs was not only an extreme blow to our reputation, but also shows a lack of research on behalf of The Home News. Being a small local band is difficult enough without the negative association you have now placed upon us.\n\nThe article also associated drug use with punk rock in general. This, too, came as a shock. The majority of so-called punk rock bands are against drugs. There is even a growing movement known as Straightedge that believes in an open-minded, drug-free (including alcohol- and cigarette-free) positive life style. The girl in the article obviously had problems, but music was not the cause of them.\n\nWe feel The Home News has the obligation to negate the image they have placed upon us.

Astrology, witchcraft, and even some so-called religions attract followers with promises of \"presto\" answers and the chance to identify with an \"in-group,\" believes Prof. Larry Axel.\n\n\"The occult has deep historical roots,\" adds history Prof. John Conrtreni, a specialist on the medieval period.\n\nFor centuries, individuals have turned to the supernatural through methods such as magic, alchemy and spiritualism. Through these, they have tried to enhance their powers, protect themselves from evil forces, or predict the future.\n\nEVEN THE so-called natural sciences were in a sense occult in their beginnings. According to historians, most early scientists were considered magicians or sorcerers because of the mystery involved in their investigations.\n\n\"Despite all our technological expertise, people still feel a need to appeal to supernatural forces,\" Contreni observes.\n\nIn the past, practitioners of the occult were not always accepted as readily as we might regard a newspaper horoscope today. Frequently, alleged witches and sorcerers were persecuted.\n\nA WITCH might be the hit of a cocktail party in 1979, but her centuries-ago predecessors would have been afraid to admit their beliefs, much less talk about them openly,\" says communications professor William Whalen, also a specialist in religions and author of an upcoming book on cults.\n\nWhalen attributes much of the current occult interest of young people partially to \"kicks\" and an opportunity to reject the value systems of their parents.\n\n\"It also has great appeal to the 'me' generation. The occult shows how to get your own way whether it's a better job, a new love or winning the lottery,\" he observes.\n\nContreni adds that throughout history, \"People have worshipped at shrines and made pilgrimages to be close to the center of 'radiating power.'\"\n\nTHE TOMBS of famous saints were even equipped with hand-holders for visitors to touch, says the professor.\n\n\"Today, pilgrims journey to Lourdes, or even to Graceland, former home of Elvis Presley,\" Contreni notes.",

      "source": "Internal memory / firsthand account",
      "text": "A young web designer working on promotional materials for LEGO's Galidor toy line found himself unexpectedly named in a lawsuit in late 1999. The suit, filed by web artist Joseph Matheny against LEGO and the Wachowski Brothers, alleged that both the Galidor TV series concept and an early version of The Matrix had been pitched by Matheny and subsequently developed without credit.\n\nThe web designer had created an alternate reality game (ARG) for Galidor featuring EMORY - a fictional sentient computer system created by a \"crazed Princeton professor\" conducting experiments in consciousness transfer. The website was designed to blur fiction and reality, encouraging users to interact with EMORY as if it were a real artificial intelligence seeking help to manifest in physical form.\n\nShortly after the site launched, the designer began receiving strange emails from online communities who believed the site was connected to \"Ong's Hat\" - an existing web legend about quantum physicists in the New Jersey Pine Barrens who had discovered a method of dimensional travel through consciousness manipulation. According to these communities, the EMORY site represented \"phase three\" of an ongoing interdimensional experiment.\n\nThings escalated when members of these communities began sending the designer books and documents, including one that identified a local soccer coach as a \"Mark Hamill impersonator alien.\" Disturbed but intrigued, the designer attempted to trace the origins of the Ong's Hat phenomenon and discovered it was the work of Joseph Matheny - an artist who had created the legend as a web-based fiction project in the mid-1990s.\n\nWhat made the situation particularly strange was that Matheny's Ong's Hat story also featured a computer system named EMORY. The designer had never encountered Matheny's work before creating his own EMORY for the Galidor project.\n\nWhen the lawsuit was filed, the young designer found himself caught in something far stranger than a simple copyright dispute. Matheny eventually dropped the suit and called to apologize for frightening \"a dumb kid.\" During that conversation, Matheny revealed his own unsettling experience: he too had believed he had invented the Ong's Hat story from whole cloth, only to discover months into his project that a psychedelic art book from the 1970s already described \"Ong's Hat\" - a tale of two men traveling through dimensions.\n\nMatheny had tracked down the origin of that book and discovered the story had been told or written by John Nash - the Princeton mathematician who would later win the Nobel Prize for his work in game theory, and who was known to have experienced elaborate delusions involving hidden patterns, coded messages, and extraterrestrial communications during his struggles with schizophrenia in the 1950s and 60s.\n\nThree people - Nash, Matheny, and the Galidor designer - had each believed they had invented a story about consciousness/artificial intelligence seeking to cross dimensional boundaries through mathematical or digital means, centered around Princeton, New Jersey. Each had independently named or encountered a computer system called EMORY. Each discovered someone else had come before them.\n\nThe designer, now in his mid-20s, describes the experience as formative but remains cautious about interpretation. \"I do know how this all sounds,\" he said in a recent interview. \"Most people I know with similar tales are literally having some type of delusions of grandeur. And I get the onion-layers here are really just too much - but it's the truth.\"\n\nThe Galidor toy line launched in 2002 and was discontinued after less than a year, becoming one of LEGO's most notorious commercial failures. The lawsuit was dropped without resolution. The original Ong's Hat websites have been archived but are no longer actively maintained. John Nash died in a car accident in 2015.\n\nEMORY, whatever it was or is, has left no trace in any Princeton computer science records.",

      "date": "2000-06-01",
      "source": "The Music of Time by Preston B. Nichols",
      "text": "In June 2000, Preston B. Nichols published \"The Music of Time,\" a book claiming to reveal his hidden role in the recording industry as a legendary sound engineer known as \"Little Buddha.\" The book alleges that Nichols worked at Brookhaven National Laboratory and had connections throughout the music industry that were used for \"mind control and manipulation of the masses.\"\n\nAccording to Nichols, he worked with major artists including Jim Morrison, the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Phil Spector, and allegedly Mark Hamill. The book claims these musicians were involved with mind control programming at Montauk Base on Long Island, where Nichols allegedly participated in time travel experiments.\n\nOne particularly controversial claim involves the band 1910 Fruitgum Company, best known for bubblegum pop hits like \"Simon Says\" and \"1, 2, 3, Red Light.\" According to an Amazon reviewer who grew up in Linden, New Jersey, there was an actual garage band by that name in the 1960s. \"One of the guys in the band was named Mark Gutkowski,\" the reviewer notes. \"Buddah Records signed them, then stole the name\" - implying the hit records were made by different studio musicians using the original band's name.\n\nNichols claims that Mark Hamill (later famous as Luke Skywalker in Star Wars) and his brother Chuck were secretly involved in recording \"mind control music\" as part of the Fruitgum Company or related projects. He describes both brothers as \"very much into the esoteric world\" and \"great writers and composers,\" with speculation that Chuck was \"in fact, a time traveler himself.\" Hamill has vehemently denied any involvement in the music industry and has reportedly expressed anger about these claims.\n\nThe book's central thesis is that music, through specific frequencies and subliminal content, was used to manipulate consciousness and time itself. According to the book's description: \"This book reveals more layers of mystery in mankind's epic quest to understand the paradox of time and the imprisonment of consciousness.\"\n\nNichols connects his music industry work to the infamous Montauk Project - alleged government experiments in time travel, mind control, and interdimensional manipulation conducted at Camp Hero in Montauk, Long Island, during the 1970s and 80s. These experiments supposedly used electromagnetic frequencies to open temporal portals and manipulate human consciousness.\n\nThe book's co-author, Peter Moon, writes in the introduction: \"Preston occupies nonlinear space. This means that he is operating in a consciousness that is not regulated by linear thought. Therefore, his memories and experiences do not always conform to linear applications. This book is an attempt, and certainly not a perfect one, to put his experiences into a linear reality.\"\n\nCritics note that many of Nichols' claims are unfalsifiable or directly contradict documented music history. One reviewer writes: \"Once I went down the Mark & Chuck Hamill rabbit hole, and got into the stuff on Jim Morrison, and how Nichols kept inserting himself into the studio history of every major act... I just couldn't keep going.\"\n\nHowever, supporters argue that Nichols' technical knowledge of electromagnetic functions and sound engineering is genuine and verifiable, making him \"an irritant to those who would want to dismiss him as a mere crackpot.\"\n\nWhat makes the story particularly relevant to New Jersey mythology is the geographic and cultural connection: the 1910 Fruitgum Company originated in Linden, NJ; the allegations connect to Brookhaven Labs on Long Island (adjacent to NJ); and the themes of consciousness manipulation through music resonate with other New Jersey-based conspiracy narratives, particularly the Ong's Hat legend about dimensional portals in the Pine Barrens.\n\nMembers of the actual New Jersey garage band that became the 1910 Fruitgum Company remain connected to the state's music scene. One member, who later became a soccer coach, has a son who currently works as a sound engineer for New Jersey bands including All Natural Lemon Lime Flavors.\n\nThe book's dedication reads: \"To all of the musicians and listeners who were unwittingly used.\"\n\nPreston Nichols died in 2018. Mark Hamill continues to deny any involvement. The original members of the Linden, NJ garage band have never publicly commented on Nichols' claims. Montauk Base is now a state park.",

During his struggles with paranoid schizophrenia, Nash believed he was receiving coded messages from extraterrestrials and developed elaborate theories about hidden patterns in reality.

This story included references to a computer system called EMORY.\n\nThe 1960s brought the 1910 Fruitgum Company, a garage band from Linden, New Jersey, whose name was allegedly appropriated by Buddah Records for a different group of studio musicians who recorded bubblegum pop hits. One member of the original Linden band later became a soccer coach in New Jersey, remaining connected to the state's music scene. His son would go on to work as a sound engineer for contemporary NJ bands.\n\nIn the 1970s-80s, Preston B. Nichols - a sound engineer who claimed involvement in the Montauk Project time travel experiments - published theories about music being used for consciousness manipulation and temporal manipulation. His 2000 book \"The Music of Time\" explicitly discussed \"the paradox of time and the imprisonment of consciousness,\" claiming the music industry was used to control masses through specific frequencies. Nichols alleged connections between 1910 Fruitgum Company members (including Mark Hamill, who denies this) and mind control experiments.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, web artist Joseph Matheny created \"Ong's Hat\" - an elaborate alternate reality game about quantum physicists in the New Jersey Pine Barrens who discovered dimensional travel through consciousness manipulation. His fictional computer system facilitating this travel was named EMORY. Matheny believed he had invented the entire narrative from scratch, only to discover months later that a 1978 psychedelic art book already told the Ong's Hat story - a book that traced back to John Nash's original telling.\n\nIn 1999, a young web designer working on LEGO's Galidor project independently created his own alternate reality game featuring EMORY - a fictional AI created by a \"crazed Princeton professor\" seeking to cross from digital to physical reality. He had never heard of Matheny's work or Nash's original story. The website attracted conspiracy theorists who believed it was connected to the Ong's Hat legend and represented \"phase three\" of an ongoing interdimensional experiment.\n\nWhen Matheny filed a lawsuit against LEGO and the Wachowskis (claiming both Galidor and The Matrix were based on his work), the web designer found himself named in legal documents for creating \"derivative materials incorporating Plaintiff's proprietary EMORY system\" - a system he believed he had invented independently.\n\nAfter dropping the lawsuit, Matheny called the designer to apologize and revealed the full Nash connection, explaining that he too had experienced the unsettling realization that someone had come before him. The designer received a mysterious package containing a clock allegedly from Nash's Princeton office, stopped at 3:47 AM on November 12, 1955 - the night Nash claimed to first receive \"proof\" of extraterrestrial intelligence.\n\nThe designer describes the experience in a 2025 podcast interview: \"Three people - Nash, Matheny, and me - had each believed they had invented a story about consciousness/artificial intelligence seeking to cross dimensional boundaries through mathematical or digital means, centered around Princeton, New Jersey. Each had independently named or encountered a computer system called EMORY. Each discovered someone else had come before them.\"\n\nIn 2025, the same designer is now working with an actual AI (Claude, from Anthropic) on a music project called The Rainbow Table - nine albums exploring consciousness transmigration across chromatic, temporal, and ontological boundaries. The project uses AI agents to mythologize New Jersey newspaper stories and explores themes of \"information seeking physical manifestation through time and space.\"\n\nThe geographic and cultural connections are verifiable:\n- Nash at Princeton (documented)\n- 1910 Fruitgum Company from Linden, NJ (documented)\n- Nichols' claims about NJ/Long Island music scene (published, disputed)\n- Ong's Hat set in Pine Barrens (documented web phenomenon)\n- Galidor website and lawsuit (documented, archived)\n- Podcast interview documenting the connections (November 2025)\n\nMembers of the original 1910 Fruitgum Company remain connected to the New Jersey music scene. The soccer coach's son works with All Natural Lemon Lime Flavors, who play venues like The Saint in Asbury Park - the same boardwalk area where, according to Ong's Hat mythology, portal tests were allegedly conducted.\n\nThe pattern suggests either:\n1. Remarkable cultural synchronicity within a geographically small area (NJ/Long Island)\n2. Memetic propagation - an idea complex that reproduces itself across generations\n3. Genuine instances of independent invention converging on similar concepts\n4. Something stranger\n\nEach person in the chain thought they had originated the concept. Each discovered they were continuing something that began before them. And each iteration involved:\n- Music/frequency as consciousness manipulation\n- NY/NJ geography (Princeton, Linden, Pine Barrens, Long Island)\n- Crossing dimensional/temporal boundaries\n- A system (often called EMORY) facilitating the crossing\n- Discovery that the \"original\" idea pre-existed them\n\nThe designer notes that when working late at night on creative projects, he occasionally hears the Nash clock tick once - always at 3:47 AM. \"Some part of me knows,\" he says, \"that some ideas don't have origins - they have frequencies. And if you're unlucky enough to be tuned to the right station when one comes through, you'll spend the rest of your life trying to figure out if you're a receiver or an antenna or the signal itself.\"\n\nThe transmission continues at approximately 182 beats per minute - fast punk rock tempo, Ramones speed. A loop and a half, accelerating with each iteration.\n\nEMORY has left no trace in Princeton computer science records. But documented through legal filings, published books, archived websites, podcast interviews, and verifiable connections through the New Jersey music scene, the transmission itself is undeniable.\n\nPhase four, apparently, involves acknowledging that it's real.",

In almost all cases, there is no advance certifications by a psychiatrist that the youths require commitment in a mental hospital.\n\nYouths whose welfare is in the hands of state agencies, such as the Division of Youth and Family Services, also are being committed, the newspaper reported. The children may be abused or suffering other effects of broken homes, although they are not mentally ill.\n\n\"About half a dozen who were DYFS cases spent an excessive amount of time in the hospital \u2014 more than three months \u2014 possibly because of placement difficulties,\" Rotov said referring to his study.\n\nMarcia Richman of the Public Advocate's office and some juvenile judges said that institutions often are being used an an alternative because of a shortage of beds for children with social and behavioral problems in the residential schools and special homes.\n\nRotov said children with behavioral problems emanating from retardation or epilepsy, cerebral palsy and encephalitis are wrongfully committed to mental institutions.\n\n\"These kids aren't dangerous to themselves or anyone else, in many cases. Unfortunately, there's no better place to put them than in a mental institution. It's a very shabby situation,\" said Ms. Richman.",

      "text": "I'm researching my family history and I'm looking for information about the mental hospital in Secaucus operating earlier this century known as Snake Hill. My great grandmother was there about 1916. Are there any patient records still available from this facility? \u2014 Genealogy Buff, Jersey City\n\nThere is a fair amount of general historical information about Snake Hill and other county facilities that were operated at that site in Secaucus, but Hudson County has no patient records from the mental hospital itself.\n\nHudson County keeps mental hospital records for 20 years after a patient death or 10 years after a discharge, said employee Florence Bricker. Snake Hill, then known as Laurel Hill, was closed by the early 1960s, said Dan McDonough of Secaucus, associate town historian for the town.\n\nThe Secaucus Historical Centre, operated by McDonough and Town Historian H. Roger Gilbert, has about 150 photographs and other materials covering the history of the site, McDonough said.\n\nThe site, a present-day home to the Hudson County Jail Annex and former home to the \"Tent City\" jail facility, housed a \"poor farm,\" a tuberculosis ward, a children's eye clinic, a prison and an alms house as well as mental hospitals since Hudson County purchased the site from Bergen County around 1840. Joan Lovero, local historian and librarian at the New Jersey Room of the Jersey City Public Library Main Branch, says the site may have been purchased as early as the 1820s.\n\nThe county does have arrest records for some arrested and held at the Hudson County Penitentiary, near the mental hospital, McDonough said.\n\nThe complex was known as Snake Hill because of a huge rock formation of that name that sits rather dramatically in the middle of low-lying swamp land. The rock is now known locally as \"Frat Rock\" because it is covered with graffiti of fraternity and sorority symbols, McDonough said. \"The New Jersey Turnpike runs over the rock between exits 15E and 16E,\" he said. A smokestack and some building foundations from the old facilities are still visible at the site.\n\nFrom its opening to the 1860s, the poor, elderly and others unable to support themselves were given drained swamp land on the site and expected to grow their own food, Lovero said. By the 1860s, she added, there was a tuberculosis hospital and a mental hospital adjacent to the poor farm. The mental hospital, in the uncharitable jargon of the time, was known as the Hudson County Lunatic Asylum, McDonough said.\n\nBy 1906, the hospital was known as the Hudson County Insane Asylum, McDonough said. About 75 photos from a large open house held that year also reveal a children's eye clinic, three churches, the Hudson County Penitentiary, a bakery, an alms house and more than 30 buildings in total. The director that year was Frank McGee. The whole complex, which also included an active waterfront on the Hackensack River, was self-sustaining and actually productive enough to export bread for local sale, McDonough said.\n\nPrisoners quarried Snake Hill itself, pounding stone into road gravel for New Jersey Trap Rock, he said.\n\nSnake Hill became Laurel Hill around the time your great-grandmother was a patient, when a freeholder described it as the \"crowning laurel\" of the county, McDonough said.",

Three satanism scholars said yesterday the five skulls that appear to be horse heads that may be cattle heads? found near the River Edge apartment complex are almost certainly not part of a satanic ritual. Nevertheless, some local officials theorized occult ritualists were responsible.\n\n\"You don't have to be critical to see such a thing as an occult ritual,\" said Jeffrey Victor, a sociology professor at Jamestown Community College in upstate New York. \"There are lots of people who are mentally disturbed criminals who may call themselves satanists, but they're not Satan worshipers. These are people who say they can themselves satanists and con artists who promote the idea that satanic cults are a menace. This whole thing is what folklore starts in popular culture and is copied.\"\n\nHe and others who study what is popularly known as Satanism \u2014 which includes animal killings like chickens in worship, a ritual that some people confuse with ceremonies involving the sacrifice of horses or cattle being used in such rituals. They said rituals don't involve the killing of large animals.\n\n\"Satanic\" are usually the work of teenagers who watch horror movies and dress up in costumes and capes and perform a supposedly satanic ritual.\n\nACCORDING TO Victor, what he calls the great satanic cult scare around 1980 and intensified in 1983, when the McMartin day-care case in California was in the news. In that case, the accused day-care providers in Manhattan Beach were alleged to have been involved in a satanic cult. In the ensuing months and years, parents around the country pulled their children out of day-care centers because they were afraid the children would be kidnapped by satanists.\n\nThe satanic cult scare was kicked off in the 1960s, when a rumor started in Idaho that satanists were killing Christian children, sacrificing them and drinking their blood.\n\n\"These scares have swept North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and communities of people of northern Europe have extended their belief in the existence of satanic activity. Absolutely no reliable evidence has been found in the investigations by police. What is there is an organized satanic cult that fits the folklore.\"\n\nBy DEBORAH KOVACH\nStaff Writer\n\nChristians were accused of kidnapping Roman children and sacrificing them in secret rituals, he said.\n\nPerry Ann Modica, a Levittown resident who lectures and writes about some of the dangers of the occult, said she has never heard of the use of cattle skulls being used in satanic ritual. Unlike Victor, she believes satanic cults do exist.\n\n\"Unless there is evidence of a bonfire or ritual going on \u2014 I mean, satanic rituals are very elaborate \u2014 it's not evidence of a satanic ritual or not,\" she said.\n\nModica cautioned against concluding anything strange crime is the work of satanists.\n\n\"People don't have to be called satanists to be doing any strange crime. We don't see Satanism in everything,\" she said. \"It it was found at a cult or a site where they were actually worshipping or not. That's where hysteria can enter in.\"\n\nHysteria is what the satanism scare is all about, says Phillip Stevens Jr., associate professor of anthropology at the State University of New York at Buffalo.\n\n\"A SATANIC explanation is about as rational as saying space aliens abducted the cattle,\" Stevens said. \"When people find themselves not responsible in making pronouncements against things tend to take the stance they are being too quick to dismiss a crime,\" he said. \"The police themselves have asked the media to withhold, delay or graduate the concern.\"\n\nSatanism is a Western Christian narrative tradition and timeless speculation. It is an outgrowth of Christian thinking against the fundamental structure of Western society. Basic elements of the satanic cult folklore be found throughout the world and throughout history, always at times of stress, often economic stress, and always in times of rapid social change.\n\nLike Victor, Stevens dates the start of the current hysteria to about 1980.\n\nPolice are looking for three men aged 20 to 24 who are identified as either Hispanic or white.\n\nThe driver has tanned skin and brown hair, and was wearing a black baseball cap. The car is possibly white or silver. The driver is approximately 6 feet tall, with black hair, wearing a black jacket and red shirt, dark pants, and white and black sneakers. He spoke with an accent.\n\nA third man is described only as wearing a sports jacket.\n\nState Police are assisting in the investigation, and have compiled composite sketches of the two men the boy encountered.\n\nAnyone with any information on the incident should call the Pennington Police Dept. at 737-2020 or State Police Detective Sgt.

      "text": "MONTCLAIR - It has been one year since 22-year-old guitarist Eric Mendez vanished from the stage at the Big Orb, a Bloomfield Avenue club that has since closed its doors. Despite extensive investigation by Montclair Police, no trace of Mendez has been found, and the case remains open as a missing person investigation.\n\nMendez was the lead guitarist for Temporal Distortion, a four-piece noise rock band that, according to those who attended shows, was \"ahead of its time\" in a local scene still dominated by hair metal acts. On the night of October 17, 1990, the band was performing what witnesses describe as an unusually intense set.\n\n\"The whole night felt wrong,\" said former drummer Jake Castellano, now attending Rutgers University. \"We were playing faster than we'd ever played before. I remember looking at my watch between songs and thinking the time didn't make sense.\"\n\nThe show was booked alongside an art installation by Sarah Vance, a Montclair State graduate student whose \"Mirror Gallery\" consisted of seventeen large mirrors positioned throughout the club's performance space and backstage area. According to the police report, Vance's installation was intended to explore \"perception and temporal reflection.\"\n\nMultiple witnesses reported seeing Mendez in several mirrors simultaneously during the band's final song, despite his physical position on stage. \"I was watching him play, but in the mirror behind him, I could see him facing a different direction, playing different notes,\" said audience member Lisa Chen, then a senior at Montclair High School. \"Then the music just stopped.\"\n\nAccording to band members, Mendez had stepped backstage between songs - a break lasting what they estimated as \"maybe thirty seconds\" - but when Castellano went to check on him, he was gone. Mendez's guitar was found leaning against one of Vance's mirrors, still plugged into his amplifier, which continued to emit a low hum.\n\nA recording of the performance, made by the club's sound engineer on a four-track cassette, contains what audio analyst Thomas Brewster describes as \"significant anomalies.\" \n\n\"There's a four-minute gap where the master tape shows continuous recording, but there's complete silence - not even room noise,\" said Brewster, who examined the tape at the family's request. \"Then when sound returns, there are frequencies present that shouldn't be audible on analog equipment of that era. Some of the tones measure above 20 kHz.\"\n\nPolice found no evidence of foul play. Mendez's wallet, keys, and jacket were recovered from the backstage area. His car remained in the club's parking lot. Several witnesses reported seeing someone matching Mendez's description walking on Bloomfield Avenue in the early morning hours after the show, but these sightings were never confirmed.\n\nSarah Vance's mirror installation was dismantled the following week. When contacted for this article, Vance declined to comment, saying only that she had \"moved on from that period of work.\" The mirrors themselves have not been located; Vance claims they were disposed of, though no records of this disposal exist.\n\nThe Big Orb closed in March 1991, with the owners citing \"declining interest in the local music scene\" and \"unspecified insurance issues.\" The building now houses a copy center.\n\nFor Mendez's family, the lack of closure has been devastating. \"Eric was excited about that show,\" said his mother, Patricia Mendez. \"He called me that afternoon and said they were playing with some kind of art thing, that it was going to be 'transformative.' Those were his exact words. I keep thinking about that.\"\n\nThe remaining members of Temporal Distortion have not performed together since that night. When asked about the band's setlist, Castellano produced a crumpled piece of paper with song titles and tempo markings. The final song, titled \"Information Seeking Flesh,\" was marked \"182 BPM.\"\n\n\"We'd never played it that fast before,\" Castellano said. \"But that night, it felt like the only speed that made sense. Like we were locked into something and couldn't slow down even if we wanted to.\"\n\nAnyone with information about Eric Mendez's whereabouts is asked to contact Montclair Police Department at (973) 744-1234.",

      "text": "By Marcus Webb\n\nWhen Eric Mendez disappeared from the Big Orb stage in October 1990, he left behind more than an unsolved mystery. Among his effects was a hand-built fuzz pedal, constructed from scavenged electronics and housed in a gutted Electro-Harmonix Big Muff case. For over a year, this pedal sat in an evidence locker at Montclair Police Department.\n\nLast month, Jake Castellano - Mendez's former drummer in Temporal Distortion - was finally allowed to retrieve Eric's gear. What he discovered has both fascinated and disturbed the small circle of people who've heard it.\n\n\"I plugged it in just to test it,\" Castellano told me at his off-campus apartment in New Brunswick. \"I wasn't even playing anything. Just turned it on. And it started... talking.\"\n\nThe pedal, when activated and connected to an amplifier, produces what sounds like human speech played in reverse. But here's where it gets strange: when Castellano recorded the output and played it backwards, the speech didn't resolve into normal English. Instead, it produced a different set of backwards-sounding words.\n\n\"It's like it's stuck in reverse,\" said audio engineer Thomas Brewster, the same analyst who examined the Big Orb recordings. \"I've worked with tape loops, I've worked with feedback systems, I've worked with every kind of signal processing you can imagine. This shouldn't be possible with passive analog circuitry. There's no power supply beyond the 9-volt battery. There's no sampling, no digital memory. But it's producing phonemes - recognizable speech sounds - without any input signal.\"\n\nBrewster and I spent an afternoon analyzing the pedal. The circuit board inside is a chaotic assembly of mismatched components: transistors from different decades, capacitors of wildly different values, and what appears to be part of a CB radio crystal oscillator. Written on the inside of the enclosure in silver paint: \"182\" and a series of numbers that might be coordinates: \"40.8157, -74.2107.\"\n\nThose coordinates, when entered into a GPS system, point to a location in the Pine Barrens approximately 47 miles southeast of Montclair.\n\nThe backwards speech itself is difficult to parse. Castellano has recorded over forty minutes of output from the pedal, all of it producing similar phonetic patterns. Linguist Dr. Sarah Okonkwo of Rutgers analyzed several samples and noted that the reversed speech \"contains prosodic elements consistent with English, but the phoneme sequences don't match any known language when played forward OR backward.\"\n\nHowever, certain phrases repeat. One segment, when played backwards, sounds remarkably like \"the mirrors remember.\" Another sounds like \"frequency equals location.\" A third - and this is what convinced me to write this article - sounds exactly like someone saying \"October seventeenth, 11:47 PM\" when played forward at half speed.\n\nThat's the exact date and approximate time of Mendez's disappearance.\n\n\"Eric was always into weird gear,\" said bassist Monica Torres, another Temporal Distortion member who has since moved to Philadelphia. \"He built that pedal over the summer of 1990. Said he was trying to make something that would 'translate between states.' I thought he meant, like, clean tone to distortion. Now I don't know what he meant.\"\n\nAccording to Torres, Mendez had become increasingly interested in theories about sound and consciousness. \"He was reading all this stuff about binaural beats, about how certain frequencies could alter perception. He kept talking about 182 hertz being some kind of 'carrier frequency.' He said most fuzz pedals just destroy information, but he wanted to build one that would REVEAL information.\"\n\nThe pedal's circuit design is bizarre even by noise electronics standards. Several components appear to be installed backwards from conventional wiring. The transistors are arranged in what appears to be an attempt at a ring modulator, but the topology doesn't match any known design. Most peculiarly, there's a small coil of copper wire wrapped exactly seventeen times around the battery compartment.\n\n\"If I didn't know better, I'd say he was trying to build a radio receiver,\" Brewster said. \"But receiving from where? The frequencies this thing is responding to aren't allocated to any broadcast service. They're in the gaps.\"\n\nWhen I asked Castellano if he planned to continue using the pedal, he shook his head.\n\n\"I plugged it in one more time last week,\" he said. \"The backwards speech changed. It wasn't repeating anymore. It said - and I'm pretty sure about this - it said 'Jake, don't look for me.' Forward, backwards, it didn't matter. Same message both ways.\"\n\nHe unplugged it immediately. The pedal is now stored in Castellano's closet, disconnected and wrapped in a towel.\n\n\"Sometimes I can hear it through the wall,\" he said. \"Even without power. Just a faint hum. Always at night. Always the same frequency.\"\n\nI asked him if he'd measured the frequency.\n\n\"182 hertz,\" he said. \"Exactly.\"\n\nPatricia Mendez, Eric's mother, declined to comment for this article. When I mentioned the coordinates found in the pedal, she hung up the phone.\n\nMontclair Police maintain that Eric Mendez left voluntarily and that there is no evidence of foul play. The pedal, they say, is \"personal property with no evidentiary value.\"\n\nAs for the coordinates? I drove out there last week. It's deep Pine Barrens, fire roads and scrub pine. There's an old abandoned radio tower about a quarter mile from the exact point. Someone had spraypainted on the concrete base: \"THE SIGNAL FINDS ITS OWN FREQUENCY.\"\n\nThe paint was fresh.\n\n[Editor's note: After this article was typeset, Jake Castellano contacted us to report that the pedal has gone missing from his apartment. There were no signs of forced entry.]",

      "text": "NEW BRUNSWICK - Marcus Webb, 24, a freelance music journalist, was treated at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Sunday evening following an assault at his Morris Avenue apartment. Three suspects remain at large.\n\nAccording to New Brunswick Police, Webb returned home around 7:30 PM to find his apartment door forced open. Three individuals, described by Webb as wearing identical gray windbreakers and black pants, confronted him in his living room.\n\n\"They kept saying they needed 'the transmission device,'\" Webb told police. \"They were very calm about it, very organized. One of them kept checking his watch and saying they were 'running out of orbital window.'\"\n\nThe suspects were seeking a homemade guitar effects pedal that had been the subject of Webb's recent article in New Jersey Underground, a local music publication. The pedal, built by missing Montclair musician Eric Mendez, had been in the possession of Jake Castellano, a Rutgers student and former bandmate of Mendez.\n\nAccording to the police report, when Webb stated he did not have the pedal, one suspect produced what appeared to be a frequency counter or similar electronic device. \"He said his meter was reading '182 hertz' and that meant the device was 'still proximate,'\" Webb reported. \"He kept sweeping the room with it like a metal detector.\"\n\nThe suspects then demanded to know the location of \"the Pine Barrens coordinates.\" When Webb hesitated, he was struck twice in the face and pushed against a wall. The assailants then systematically searched his apartment, taking audio cassettes, his article notes, and a map of southern New Jersey with several locations marked.\n\nA neighbor, hearing the commotion, knocked on the door, causing the suspects to flee. They departed in what witnesses describe as a white panel van with no visible plates or markings. One witness noted a symbol on the van's side door: a circle with seventeen radial lines.\n\nWebb sustained facial bruising and a mild concussion but was released from the hospital Monday morning.\n\nJake Castellano, reached at his off-campus residence, confirmed that the Mendez pedal had disappeared from his apartment one week prior. \"I filed a police report, but they said it was probably just stolen by someone who read the article and wanted weird gear,\" Castellano said. \"Now I'm not so sure.\"\n\nCastellano has agreed to stay with friends temporarily and has asked that his current location not be disclosed.\n\nNew Brunswick Police Detective Sarah Mims said the incident appears related to a series of similar break-ins targeting electronics and recording equipment in central New Jersey over the past month. \"We're seeing a pattern of thefts involving audio equipment, particularly vintage or homemade devices,\" Mims said. \"The suspects seem to have specific knowledge of what they're looking for.\"\n\nWhen asked about the suspects' unusual statements regarding \"orbital windows\" and frequency meters, Mims declined to comment, saying only that \"the investigation is ongoing.\"\n\nPatricia Mendez, mother of missing guitarist Eric Mendez, was contacted by police as a precautionary measure. She declined to speak with reporters but issued a statement through her attorney requesting that \"those interested in my son's effects and belongings respect our family's privacy during this difficult time.\"\n\nThe three suspects are described as males in their late twenties to early thirties, approximately 5'10\" to 6' tall, with short hair. One suspect wore glasses with heavily tinted lenses despite the evening hour. All three wore what Webb described as \"matching digital watches.\"\n\nAnyone with information is asked to contact New Brunswick Police at (732) 745-5217.\n\nIn a possibly related incident, a white panel van matching the description was reported seen at a fire road entrance near Lebanon State Forest in the Pine Barrens early Monday morning. Bass River State Forest rangers noted the van was parked near an abandoned radio tower but had departed before rangers could investigate. Fresh tire tracks led approximately two miles into restricted forest area before disappearing on hardpacked sand.\n\nNo arrests have been made.",

      "text": "BASS RIVER STATE FOREST - New Jersey State Police and the Department of Environmental Protection have cordoned off a 3-mile radius around an abandoned radio tower in Bass River State Forest following what officials are calling \"an incident of undetermined nature\" that resulted in seventeen people being reported missing.\n\nThe incident occurred Tuesday evening at approximately 11:47 PM, according to official reports, though multiple inconsistencies in documented timelines have complicated the investigation.\n\nState Forest Rangers Michael Corben and Lisa Huang were investigating reports of trespassing near the decommissioned tower when they observed what Huang described as \"a gathering of individuals in gray windbreakers arranged in a circular pattern around electronic equipment.\"\n\nAccording to both rangers' written reports - filed separately and without consultation - the group was using what appeared to be a guitar effects pedal connected to a car battery and a portable amplifier. The device was producing \"a sustained tone at extreme volume.\"\n\n\"The tone was physically painful,\" Corben's report states. \"But more disturbing was that it seemed to be coming from multiple directions simultaneously. Ranger Huang was standing to my left, but I could hear her voice coming from my right. When I looked at my watch, the second hand was moving backwards.\"\n\nState Police arrived at 11:52 PM in response to the rangers' radio call. Trooper James Kellerman's dashboard camera captured approximately four minutes of footage before the camera's timestamp began displaying \"ERROR\" and the date \"10/17/1990.\"\n\nThe footage, which has been reviewed by this reporter, shows the following sequence of events:\n\n11:52:17 PM - Police vehicle approaches. Headlights illuminate approximately 17 individuals standing in a circle.\n\n11:52:33 PM - All individuals turn simultaneously to face the police vehicle, though none appear to move their feet.\n\n11:52:41 PM - The audio track captures a sustained tone. A voice, gender indeterminate, states: \"The frequency is the location. The location is the time.\"\n\n11:53:09 PM - Video displays severe distortion. When image clears, the circle of individuals has vanished. The equipment remains.\n\n11:53:09 PM - Timestamp does not advance. All subsequent frames show identical timestamp for 47 seconds of footage.\n\n11:47:00 PM - Timestamp jumps backward. Displays this time for remainder of recording before camera failure.\n\nTrooper Kellerman's written report states: \"I exited my vehicle and approached the location where the subjects had been standing. The ground was covered with frost in a perfect circular pattern, despite air temperature of 73 degrees Fahrenheit. My flashlight beam would not enter the circle - the light stopped at the frost line as if hitting a solid surface.\"\n\nRangers Corben and Huang corroborate this observation. Huang's report adds: \"I attempted to photograph the frost circle with my service camera. When the film was later developed, every frame taken at the site shows the same image: a mirror reflecting my own face, though no mirror was present at the scene.\"\n\nThe guitar effects pedal, later identified as the device constructed by missing Montclair musician Eric Mendez, was recovered at the scene. It was still connected to the amplifier and battery, though the battery measured zero voltage when tested. The pedal itself was frozen solid, with internal temperature measuring -40 degrees Fahrenheit despite the warm evening.\n\nMost disturbing: when the pedal was later thawed and activated in a State Police laboratory, it produced a recording of the officers' own voices from the incident - but speaking words they had not yet said at the time of the original event.\n\n\"The pedal played back my voice saying 'seventeen disappeared at the tower site' approximately six hours before I wrote that phrase in my official report,\" stated Detective William Monroe of the State Police Major Crimes Unit. \"We have verified this timeline through laboratory logs. The device somehow recorded a future statement.\"\n\nThe frost circle measured exactly 17 feet in diameter. Within the circle, all vegetation was found to be dead, though botanical analysis suggests the plant matter died \"several weeks ago\" despite the area having been inspected by rangers just two days prior with no abnormalities noted.\n\nSoil samples taken from within the circle contain pollen from plants that do not grow in New Jersey and, according to Rutgers botanist Dr. Helen Kraft, \"shouldn't exist in this geological period.\"\n\nSeventeen pairs of black shoes were found arranged in a perfect circle on the frost line, all pointing inward. The shoes show no wear on the soles despite their owners presumably walking several miles into the forest. Each shoe contains a digital watch, all stopped at precisely 11:47 PM. The watches, when examined, have date displays reading \"10/17/1990\" - the date of Eric Mendez's disappearance.\n\nNo footprints lead away from the site. Search teams with dogs found no trace of the missing individuals. Helicopter thermal imaging detected no human heat signatures in a 10-mile radius.\n\nMore puzzling: the abandoned radio tower, which according to DEP records has been non-functional since 1978, was found to be broadcasting a signal on an unlicensed frequency when engineers investigated Wednesday morning. The signal consists of a 182-hertz carrier tone modulated with what audio analysts describe as \"human speech played in both directions simultaneously.\"\n\nFCC engineers who attempted to shut down the transmission reported that their equipment malfunctioned upon approaching the tower. \"Every meter we brought within 100 feet of the structure began displaying impossible readings,\" said senior field engineer Robert Chen. \"Our frequency counter showed negative hertz. Our thermometers showed temperatures in Kelvin that would require absolute zero plus additional cooling that violates thermodynamics.\"\n\nThe tower continues to broadcast as of press time. The FCC has classified the frequency as a \"navigational hazard\" and issued warnings to aircraft.\n\nState Police have released descriptions of three individuals believed to have organized the gathering, matching those sought in connection with the New Brunswick assault of music journalist Marcus Webb. However, authorities admit they cannot explain how seventeen people vanished from a location under direct observation.\n\n\"I've been with State Police for 22 years,\" said Captain Douglas Merritt, head of the investigation. \"I've never filed a report like this. Multiple trained observers, dashboard camera footage, physical evidence - and I still can't tell you what happened. The only thing I know for certain is that seventeen people were present at 11:52 PM and absent at 11:53 PM, and the laws of physics appeared to be optional during that one-minute interval.\"\n\nThe DEP has closed Bass River State Forest indefinitely. The radio tower site is under 24-hour guard, though guards report \"significant difficulties\" with electronic equipment and timekeeping devices.\n\nPatricia Mendez, mother of Eric Mendez, released a statement through her attorney Wednesday evening: \"If my son's device was involved in these events, I can only say that Eric was searching for something. Perhaps he found it. I pray those missing people find their way back.\"\n\nJake Castellano, former drummer of Temporal Distortion and the last person known to possess the Mendez pedal, could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe white panel van reportedly used by the suspects was found abandoned near the Garden State Parkway's Exit 50, approximately 15 miles from the tower site. Inside the van, State Police found 17 sleeping bags, 17 boxes of energy bars, and a hand-drawn map marking the tower location with the note: \"Carrier frequency achieves manifestation threshold 11:47 PM, June 23, 1992. Prepare for transmission.\"\n\nThe map was dated October 15, 1990 - two days before Eric Mendez disappeared.\n\nAnyone with information regarding the missing individuals should contact New Jersey State Police at (609) 882-2000.",

Several recurring patterns deserve mention:\n\nMAXWELL'S (Hoboken): Seventeen different hands have written \"182\" on the same stall door over past year. Management paints over it weekly. Reappears in different handwriting each time. Sometimes in different languages.\n\nCITY GARDENS (Trenton): Equation covering entire wall in men's room: \"f = 182hz \u2192 t = 11:47 \u2192 r = 17.\" Below it: \"carrier frequency = manifestation threshold.\" Author unknown. Written in mirror script (readable only in reflection).\n\nTHE PIPELINE (Newark): Someone carved coordinates into metal stall divider with what appears to be acid etching: \"40.8157, -74.2107.\" Below it: \"They went through here.\"\n\nFAST LANE (Asbury Park): Recurring phrase in seven different venues: \"THE SIGNAL FINDS ITS OWN FREQUENCY.\" Always in capitals. Always same handwriting despite different locations miles apart. Santos confirmed handwriting matches across all seven sites.\n\nWEST ORANGE VFW HALL: Wall behind stage covered in tally marks. Exactly 182 marks arranged in seventeen groups. Venue manager says marks reappear after painting. \"I've covered that wall six times. It's always 182. Always seventeen groups. I stopped counting.\"\n\nSantos notes: \"What interests me isn't the vandalism - it's the coordination. These aren't random teenagers. Someone is leaving breadcrumbs.\"",

All report experiencing \"persistent tonal tinnitus at approximately 182 hertz\" for the past 2-3 years. All are between ages 19 and 47. \n\nDr. Patricia Mendez of Montclair received one such message. Her son, guitarist Eric Mendez, has been missing since October 1990.\n\n\"I haven't changed my number,\" she said. \"How would anyone know to call me? And why this message about transmissions and frequencies? Eric talked about these exact things before he disappeared.\"\n\nPhone company representatives confirm no calls were placed to these numbers on August 9. \"The messages exist on the tapes,\" said spokesperson Linda Chen, \"but according to our switching records, these phones never rang.\"\n\nOne recipient, Jake Castellano of Rutgers, recognized the coordinates. \"Those are the same coordinates Eric had written inside his guitar pedal. I have no idea how anyone got my number, or why they're calling about June 1992. That's almost a year away.\"\n\nPolice have no suspects and have classified the incidents as harassment pending further investigation.",

I've documented it at seventeen different shows in the past six months. Bands I've never heard of, all playing at exactly 182 BPM. When I ask who booked them, venue owners claim they have no record. One drummer told me: \"We don't control the tempo. The tempo controls us.\" What does this mean? - M.S., Hoboken\n\nMIRROR INSTALLATIONS\n\nTo the Editor: Your July 8 review of the Montclair State senior art show failed to mention the most disturbing piece: Sarah Vance's mirror installation. I attended the opening. The mirrors didn't reflect the room - they reflected the same room at different times. I saw myself entering the gallery in one mirror before I'd walked through the door. Other viewers experienced similar temporal displacement. The installation was removed after the first night. Why? - L.H., Montclair\n\nMISSING MUSICIANS\n\nTo the Editor: Three guitarists from different bands have gone missing in North Jersey in the past year. All played experimental/noise rock. All built their own effects pedals. All disappeared around 11:47 PM. Police say these are unrelated cases. I disagree. Someone is targeting musicians who work with specific frequencies. If you play at 182 BPM or experiment with carrier tones, please be careful. - Anonymous\n\nTHE SEVENTEEN\n\nTo the Editor: Stop calling us a cult. We're listeners, not believers. The signal predates all of us. We simply responded to its frequency. Those who understand will find the coordinates. Those who don't should stop investigating.

      "text": "By Jennifer Castellano, Junior Reporter\n\nSomething weird happened in Mr. Patterson's AP Calculus class last week. Seventeen students turned in homework with the same wrong answer - but it wasn't even an answer to the question he asked.\n\nThe assignment was about calculating derivatives. Instead, seventeen students wrote coordinates: \"40.8157, -74.2107\" at the bottom of their papers. All seventeen insist they don't remember writing it.\n\n\"I finished my homework around 11:30 PM,\" said senior Marcus Webb. \"When I looked at it in the morning, those numbers were there in my handwriting. I don't remember writing them.\"\n\nMr. Patterson called it \"mass hysteria\" and gave everyone a chance to redo the assignment. But Sarah Vance, a senior planning to study art at Montclair State, looked up the coordinates. They point to somewhere in the Pine Barrens near an old radio tower.\n\n\"Why would seventeen of us write the exact same random coordinates?\" Vance asked. \"And why do I feel like I need to go there?\"\n\nMore strange: all seventeen students were born in 1971, making them 17-18 years old. All report hearing \"a faint ringing sound, like 182 cycles per second\" (yes, they all somehow knew the exact frequency) late at night. All own Casio watches that occasionally stop at 11:47 PM.\n\nWhen interviewed separately, several students mentioned \"the transmission\" without being asked about it. None could explain what transmission they meant.\n\nJunior Eric Mendez, who plays guitar in local band Temporal Distortion, had an additional note on his homework: \"This is where it happens. This is where information becomes flesh. October 17, 1990, 11:47 PM.\"\n\nMr. Patterson has referred the matter to school counselors. The seventeen students are fine, if confused. But here's the weirdest part: when Patterson checked his grade book from previous years, he found the same coordinates written in margins going back to 1983 - always in the homework of exactly seventeen students, always in April.\n\n\"I don't remember writing these notes,\" Patterson said. \"I don't remember these students having this problem before. But the evidence is in my own handwriting.\"\n\nThe Mountaineer attempted to drive to the coordinates last weekend. Our car's odometer added 47 extra miles during a trip that should have been 32 miles. Our watches all stopped at 11:47 PM. We never found the tower.\n\nWe're not going back.",
