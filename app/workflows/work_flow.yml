step_four: Review and rate these plans.
step_five: Link the reviewed plans to the track manifest
step_six: Create a parquet file per track
step_seven: Initialize the agent workflow starting with Subutai who will use concept prompts to generate the basics of a plan.
step_eight: Subutai will build on the plan by adding details based on the training samples.
step_nine: Subutai will critique the plan using the feedback from the reference plans, his feedback should then be incorporated into the plan.
step_ten: Subutai will then generate a final plan based on the feedback and the reference plans, and save this to a yaml file.
step_eleven: Andy will start by grouping the plan's song structures into "parts" A, B, C, etc.
step_twelve: Andy will have Nancarrow generate chords for each part and the produce a the foundational MIDI chord structure.

step_seventeen: This process will continue until the new track is "accepted" or "abandoned"
