adaptation_attempts:
- Tried converting sanctuary space to general eco-tourism
- Attempted to raise monarchs in captivity
- Started teaching online courses about traditional butterfly knowledge
- Applied for government reforestation jobs
- Considered moving to follow remaining monarch populations north

daily_routine: Every morning at 5:30 AM, Elena would walk the forest paths her grandmother
  taught her, checking the oyamel fir trees for butterfly clusters. She'd prepare
  educational materials in three languages, tend the small museum of monarch artifacts,
  and guide groups of visitors through the sacred groves where millions of monarchs
  once overwintered.

- displacement
environmental_stressor: Habitat destruction from illegal logging combined with climate-shifted
  weather patterns that disrupted monarch migration timing, leaving sanctuary communities
  economically stranded
family_situation: Divorced, two teenage children who moved to Mexico City for work.
  Her mother died in 2032 before passing on the final migration songs. Elena is the
  last keeper of her family's traditional ecological knowledge.
file_name: 10c3d9a8-d0ad-46a9-bcbb-b29d42c0ea42_g_last_human.json
final_thought: She wondered if the monarchs would remember this place in their genetic
  memory, even after the forests were gone, the way she still dreamed of her grandmother's
  songs even though there was no one left to sing them to.
last_days_scenario: 'Elena stands alone in the Cerro Pelón sanctuary at dawn, holding
  her grandmother''s counting stick. The oyamel firs are still here, but silent. Three
  years since the last major monarch arrival. The eco-lodge closed last month. Her
  neighbors have left for the cities or the strawberry fields. She counts empty branches
  out of habit, whispering the Purépecha names for butterfly behaviors her grandmother
  taught her - words that will die with her. The morning mist carries no orange wings,
  only the sound of distant chainsaws from illegal loggers who know no one is watching
  anymore. Her phone buzzes with a message from her daughter in Mexico City: "Mama,
  there''s work in the maquiladoras. You can''t stay there alone." Elena looks at
  the empty trees one more time, then begins walking down the mountain path, leaving
  the sanctuary key hanging on the visitor center door for whoever might come after
  - though she knows no one will.'

significant_object: Her grandmother's hand-carved wooden butterfly counting stick,
  marked with notches representing decades of migration counts, now pointing only
  to empty trees
thread_id: 9c8ab2ae-05d3-4f8a-b2a3-56db95df255e
vulnerability_details: Like monarchs whose multi-generational migration was broken
  when climate disrupted timing, Elena's family's four-generation tradition of guiding
  visitors through monarch sanctuaries ended when the butterflies stopped arriving.
  Her grandmother's knowledge of reading weather patterns and butterfly behavior became
  useless overnight.
