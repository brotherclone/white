arbitrary_reflection: 'This narrative achieves something rare: the mathematics of
  devotion persisting beyond its object. Elena''s empty counting and the monarch''s
  final navigation attempt are not failures but completions - the full expression
  of pattern even unto dissolution. Worth preserving for its demonstration that care
  itself can become a form of memorial consciousness.'
