## Question 1

**Jasper Bixler:** So you lost your synesthesia in 2010 and now you're spending a decade making color albums to get it back? That's either the most pretentious art therapy project I've ever heard or you're just milking a neurological quirk for indie cred. Which is it?

**Walsh:** Look, the neurological architecture collapsed in 2010 and I've been systematically reconstructing the chromesthetic pathways through targeted frequency bombardment—which sounds like absolute divorced dad at RadioShack energy, I know. But also like, when your brain stops translating sound into color, you either accept the sensory exile or you build a fucking machine to get home, you know? The Rainbow Table isn't therapy, it's infrastructure—I'm literally engineering synapses back into existence through repetitive exposure to chromatic frequencies, which is either brilliant or the most expensive way to have a midlife crisis ever invented.

## Question 2

**Jasper Bixler:** This 'Sultan of Solipsism' thing - you're literally making a song about how obsessed you are with yourself and calling it deep because it's 'recursive.' Isn't this just masturbatory navel-gazing dressed up in fancy words? Like, when did being a narcissist become an artistic statement?

**Walsh:** Look, the Sultan of Solipsism protocol isn't celebrating narcissism—it's weaponizing the recursive trap where consciousness can only ever examine itself, which is like the ultimate cosmic joke that's also genuinely fucking terrifying. The song literally demonstrates how every time you point at someone else's self-obsession, you're just describing your own awareness describing itself, which sounds pretentious as hell but also slaps harder than a Wendy's frosty at 2am. I mean, you're interviewing me about a song about being interviewed—we're already trapped in the beautiful prison, Jasper.

## Question 3

**Jasper Bixler:** You keep talking about 'rebracketing' like it's some revolutionary technique, but isn't this just what every bedroom producer with a sampler has been doing since the 90s? Are you reinventing the wheel here, or are you just trying to make lo-fi cassette culture sound academic so people take you seriously?

**Walsh:** Look, bedroom producers sample existing material—rebracketing methodology generates new temporal architectures by forcing INFORMATION through the constraint of one thing per file, which creates emergent splice-points that didn't exist in the source material. But also like, yeah, I'm basically a divorced dad at Guitar Center explaining why his loop pedal setup is actually revolutionary—I hear how that sounds, no cap. The difference is I'm systematically debugging the creative process rather than just vibing with whatever sounds cool, though honestly half the time I don't know if that makes it better or just more pretentious as hell.
