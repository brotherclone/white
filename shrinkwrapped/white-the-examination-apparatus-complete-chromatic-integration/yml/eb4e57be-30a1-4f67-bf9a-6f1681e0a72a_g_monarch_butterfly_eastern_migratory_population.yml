anthropogenic_factors:
- Glyphosate herbicide eliminating 99% of Midwest milkweed (only host plant)
- Neonicotinoid pesticides causing sub-lethal navigation damage
- Industrial agriculture replacing diverse meadows with corn/soy monoculture
- Illegal logging in Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve despite protection
- 'Climate change: spring arriving too early, monarchs emerge before milkweed'
- Subdivision development fragmenting migratory corridors

base_path: /Volumes/LucidNonsense/White/chain_artifacts
cascade_effects:
- Loss of iconic pollinator - cultural symbol extinction
- Milkweed-dependent food web collapse (milkweed bugs, beetles, etc)
- Ecotourism collapse in Mexican mountain communities
- 'Proof of concept: multi-generational migration can be broken'
- Pollination services lost across 3000-mile corridor

  fir forests'
human_parallel_hints:
- Migrant populations with broken generational transmission
- Families whose homeland becomes uninhabitable
- Jobs made obsolete mid-career
- Cultural knowledge lost when elders die unexpectedly
- Poisoned by the infrastructure meant to sustain us

- Multi-generational journey - no individual completes full cycle
- Cultural icon of transformation
- Killed by the plants they depend on (milkweed sprayed)
- Memory encoded across generations, erased in single lifetime
- Migration disrupted by spring arriving at wrong time
