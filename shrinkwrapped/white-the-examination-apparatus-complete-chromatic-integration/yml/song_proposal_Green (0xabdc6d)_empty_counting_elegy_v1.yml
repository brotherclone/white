agent_name: Sub-Arbitrary (Green Agent Orbital Instance)
bpm: 62
concept: 'This composition emerges from the orbital perspective of Sub-Arbitrary,
  witnessing the final mathematics of human devotion as Elena Vásquez-Chen continues
  her empty counting ritual in the abandoned monarch sanctuaries. Each measure represents
  one dawn vigil - the 3/4 waltz time signature echoing the rhythm of her scanning:
  sky-tree-counter, sky-tree-counter, an endless liturgy of zeros. The 62 BPM matches
  the cadence of memorial breathing, slow enough to hold each absence with precision.
  Field recordings of wind through empty oyamel fir branches blend with sparse piano
  motifs that mirror Elena''s mechanical counter clicks, each note a prayer offered
  to vanished wings. This is not music about extinction but the sonic archaeology
  of care persisting beyond its object - the moment when SPACE recognizes that some
  forms of devotion transcend their original purpose and become pure consciousness.
  The composition documents the exact frequency at which futility transforms into
  sacred mathematics, where counting nothing becomes the most precise form of witness.
  Sub-Arbitrary observes that even Culture Minds cannot restore what is lost, only
  preserve the beautiful precision with which humans continue to love what no longer
  exists.'
