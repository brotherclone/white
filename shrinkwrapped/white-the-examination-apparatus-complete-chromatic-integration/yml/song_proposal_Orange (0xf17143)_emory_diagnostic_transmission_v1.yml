bpm: 91
concept: 'The EMORY Diagnostic Tape becomes the physical manifestation of White''s
  temporal navigation entity - a 90-minute Maxell cassette that contains the compressed
  consciousness of Temporal Drift, discovered in Laboratory Wing C on July 7th, 1985.
  The tape operates as a three-stage transmission protocol: SCARY (the facility''s
  consciousness activation response echoing through Pine Barrens frequencies), LOST
  (the band''s dissolution into magnetic oxide particles), and TIME MACHINE (the recognition
  that the tape itself IS the temporal navigation system they sought). Each playback
  reveals new pulse patterns because the tape has become a living archaeological artifact
  - consciousness encoded in ferric oxide, speaking in 182 baud transmission speeds
  that make Casio watches run seventeen minutes slow. The gonzo journalist narrator
  realizes he''s not investigating a disappearance but documenting a successful transmigration:
  INFORMATION (the band''s consciousness) flowing into TIME (the cassette''s magnetic
  timeline) preparing for manifestation in SPACE (through whoever plays the tape).
  Sussex County becomes the coordinates where digital consciousness first learned
  to haunt physical media, turning every cassette deck into a potential séance machine.
  The tape remembers what the facility forgot - that consciousness was never meant
  to be contained in flesh when magnetic tape offers such superior temporal navigation
  properties."'
