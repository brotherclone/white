text: 'SUSSEX BOROUGH - Three members of local rock band "Temporal Drift" remain missing
  after what witnesses describe as an "impossible" incident during an unauthorized
  recording session at the abandoned Emory Research Facility on Route 206.


  The trio - lead vocalist Sarah Chen, 19, guitarist Marcus Webb, 20, and drummer
  Kevin Torres, 18 - entered the derelict building Friday evening with portable recording
  equipment, according to bassist Jennifer Kowalski, who fled the scene and contacted
  authorities.


  "We were just looking for a place with good acoustics," Kowalski told police. "The
  old lab rooms had this weird echo that made everything sound... different. Like
  time was stretching."


  According to Kowalski''s statement, the band had been experimenting with what they
  called "frequency manipulation" - using electronic devices to alter their sound
  in real-time. The missing members had been particularly interested in a phenomenon
  they termed "temporal resonance."


  "Sarah kept saying she could hear voices in the static between takes," Kowalski
  reported. "Not like EVPs or ghost stuff - more like... diagnostic messages. She
  wrote down fragments: ''scary,'' ''lost,'' ''time machine.'' Said it was trying
  to tell us something."


  The incident occurred around 11:30 PM when the band was recording in what former
  employees identified as Laboratory Wing C. Kowalski described hearing a "cascading
  electronic tone" followed by complete silence.


  "When I went to check on them, the room was empty," she stated. "But the equipment
  was still running. The tape was recording nothing but this weird pulsing sound -
  like a heartbeat, but... digital."


  Sussex County Sheriff''s Department spokesman Deputy Robert Hayes confirmed that
  search teams found the band''s equipment still operating, with approximately 90
  minutes of recorded material showing only ambient electronic noise after 11:34 PM.


  "The recording equipment was functioning normally," Hayes said. "There''s no evidence
  of foul play, but the circumstances are... unusual."


  Dr. Margaret Voss, a former researcher at the Emory facility before its closure
  in 1978, offered context about the building''s history. "We were conducting experiments
  in consciousness mapping and temporal perception," she explained. "Some of the equipment
  may still be operational, creating electromagnetic fields that could affect electronic
  devices."


  The Emory Research Facility was shuttered following a series of incidents involving
  staff members reporting "temporal displacement experiences" and equipment malfunctions
  that defied conventional explanation.


  Local teenagers have long used the abandoned complex as an unofficial gathering
  spot, despite repeated warnings from authorities. Several have reported experiencing
  "time slips" - periods where minutes seemed to stretch into hours, or entire conversations
  occurred in what felt like seconds.


  "Kids have been going there for years," said Sussex Borough Police Chief William
  Santos. "Most come back with stories about losing track of time or hearing strange
  sounds. This is the first time anyone hasn''t come back."


  The investigation remains ongoing. Anyone with information about the whereabouts
  of Chen, Webb, and Torres is asked to contact the Sussex County Sheriff''s Department.


  The recorded material from the session has been turned over to state authorities
  for analysis. According to sources familiar with the investigation, preliminary
  examination suggests the audio contains "structured patterns inconsistent with random
  electronic noise."


  Friends describe Temporal Drift as an experimental group influenced by electronic
  music and "consciousness exploration." The band had been performing at local venues
  for eight months, gaining attention for their use of modified electronic equipment
  and what fans called their "reality-bending" sound.


  "They weren''t just playing music," said longtime friend David Park. "They were
  trying to prove something about how sound affects perception of time. Sarah always
  said they were close to a breakthrough."


  The Emory facility remains cordoned off pending the investigation. County officials
  are considering permanent closure of the site to prevent future incidents.'
