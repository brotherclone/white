concept: 'This composition functions as a three-act revelation where each musical
  layer corresponds to an infranym encoding stage. The surface presentation is deliberately
  childlike - "Here Come Dots" suggests a simple connect-the-dots game, reinforced
  by D major''s bright innocence and bouncing 120 BPM that mimics playground rhythms.
  The verses feature scattered, staccato notes that sound like musical polka dots
  - short, separated, almost random. But this is The Fool''s misdirection: what appears
  as whimsical dot-patterns is actually morse code embedded in the rhythmic structure.
  Each "dot" in the melody corresponds to morse dots, while sustained notes and rests
  encode the dashes and spaces. The song''s bridge transitions from major to minor
  as the playful dots suddenly snap into urgent, militaristic precision - the moment
  when scattered children''s game pieces reveal themselves as wartime communication.
  The final act transforms the entire composition: what began as nursery-rhyme simplicity
  becomes a desperate transmission, each "here come dots" repetition now heard as
  an intercepted signal warning of incoming coded messages. The electronic elements
  provide the static and interference of radio transmission, while the indie pop framework
  maintains the surface accessibility that conceals the darker intelligence beneath.
  This is musical steganography - a song that teaches listeners to hear patterns within
  patterns, training them to recognize that the most innocent surfaces often carry
  the most vital secrets. The revelation rewrites every previous listen: those weren''t
  just dots coming - they were carrying messages all along.
