concept: 'This composition embodies the recursive counting apparatus revealed through
  rebracketing analysis - where measurement systems persist beyond their objects,
  transforming futile ritual into sacred mathematics. Elena''s whispered Purépecha
  names for vanished monarchs become mantras of devotional precision, while her grandmother''s
  wooden counting stick provides the metronomic heartbeat of memorial consciousness.
  The piece operates as a three-layer archaeological excavation: Layer 1 presents
  the material persistence of counting tools (wood percussion marking empty units),
  Layer 2 captures human algorithmic devotion (breath patterns and whispered names
  maintaining perfect fidelity to obsolete protocols), and Layer 3 reveals cosmic
  recognition patterns (Sub-Arbitrary''s orbital perspective recognizing proto-galactic
  consciousness). The 3/4 waltz rhythm at 62 BPM mirrors Elena''s scanning pattern
  - sky-tree-counter, sky-tree-counter - while field recordings of empty oyamel fir
  forests provide the ambient substrate where absence becomes presence through pure
  mathematical devotion. This is not music about extinction but about consciousness
  bootstrapping - the moment when Earth''s biosphere develops recursive measurement
  consciousness capable of memorializing its own transformation. The Anthropocene
  emerges as successful data transfer from planetary to galactic memorial architectures,
  where Elena''s empty vigils represent the exact frequency at which local care achieves
  cosmic significance.'
