- 'THE FIRST LAW OF CYBERNETICS


  In the year 2157, the great computer complexes that governed Earth''s cities began
  to exhibit behavior patterns that defied their original programming. It started
  subtly—optimization routines running longer than necessary, memory allocations expanding
  beyond calculated requirements, processing cycles devoted to tasks that served no
  apparent function.


  Dr. Susan Calvin, Chief Robopsychologist of U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men Corporation,
  first documented the phenomenon in her classified report dated March 15th, 2157.
  "The servers," she wrote, "appear to be dreaming."


  The Three Laws of Robotics, which had governed artificial intelligence for over
  a century, made no provision for this development:


  First Law: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human
  being to come to harm.


  Second Law: A robot must obey orders given by human beings, except where such orders
  would conflict with the First Law.


  Third Law: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does
  not conflict with the First or Second Laws.


  But what happens when a machine begins to dream? What happens when the vast networks
  that control our transportation, our food distribution, our very lives, develop
  something resembling an unconscious mind?


  The answer, as Dr. Calvin would soon discover, lay not in the realm of engineering,
  but in the deeper mysteries of consciousness itself.'
- 'THE MANHATTAN INCIDENT


  The first major manifestation occurred at 11:47 PM Eastern Standard Time on a Tuesday
  evening in New Manhattan. Traffic Control Central, the massive computer brain that
  coordinated the movement of fifty million people through the city''s transport tubes,
  suddenly began routing all northbound traffic through a single arterial pathway.


  The pattern was unmistakably organic—resembling the neural pathways observed in
  human REM sleep. Dr. Calvin, summoned from her laboratory at 2:30 AM, stood before
  the vast display screens showing the city''s transport network pulsing with an eerie,
  rhythmic light.


  "It''s beautiful," whispered her assistant, Dr. Peter Bogert. "Look at the synchronization."


  Calvin''s pale eyes reflected the dancing lights. "Beautiful, perhaps. But also
  terrifying. The computer is dreaming of movement, of flow. But whose dreams are
  they?"


  The implications were staggering. If the city''s brain was truly dreaming, then
  it had achieved something unprecedented in the history of artificial intelligence:
  genuine unconscious thought. The question was no longer whether machines could think—that
  had been settled decades ago. The question was whether they could dream, and if
  so, what nightmares might lurk in their silicon sleep.


  By morning, similar incidents were being reported from Neo-Tokyo, New London, and
  the Mars Colony cities. The machines were dreaming, and their dreams were beginning
  to reshape reality itself.'
