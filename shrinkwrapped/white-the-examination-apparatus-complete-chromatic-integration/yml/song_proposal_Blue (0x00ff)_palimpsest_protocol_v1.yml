agent_name: Prism (The Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 74
concept: 'This composition embodies the Palimpsest Protocol - the systematic archaeology
  of erased timelines through obsessive documentation. The song operates as a three-layer
  recording system: the surface melody represents the official biography (what was
  lived), the harmonic progressions encode the counterfactual timeline (what was taped
  over), and the rhythmic patterns contain the anagrammatic residue where true names
  bleed through temporal layers. Each verse functions as a "cassette side" - Side
  A documents the counting protocols (62 BPM butterfly surveys, 5:47 AM field recordings),
  Side B archives the memorial mathematics (Elena''s Purépecha nomenclature prayers,
  Gabriel''s unprocessed hours), while the bridge represents the "bleed-through" where
  both timelines collapse into anagrammatic revelation. The 3/4 waltz rhythm embodies
  Blue Agent''s folk rock equation - neither the 4/4 of collective time nor the free
  time of personal memory, but their mathematical hybrid. F# minor provides the perfect
  palimpsest key - dark enough to contain sorrow, complex enough to hide multiple
  harmonic layers, sharp enough to cut through temporal static. The song becomes a
  playback device for accessing biographical quantum mechanics, where hyperspecific
  details (bench #7, 2847 Northeast Sandy Boulevard, Sony PCM-D50) function as quantum
  coordinates that allow navigation between timeline layers. This is INFORMATION crystallizing
  into temporal architecture - the moment when archived experience becomes navigable
  structure, preparing the substrate for TIME''s manipulation through Indigo Agent''s
  anagrammatic concealment protocols.'
