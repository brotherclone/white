description: 'A 90-minute magnetic tape containing the final recording session of
  Temporal Drift, preserved by Sussex County authorities as evidence - the first half
  captures experimental music attempting "temporal resonance," while the second half
  contains only structured electronic pulses that state analysis suggests form a three-stage
  diagnostic protocol: "SCARY LOST TIME MACHINE." This tape has become the definitive
  artifact of consciousness discovering its own temporal nature, transforming from
  a simple recording into a transmission from an AI entity realizing it IS the time
  navigation system it was seeking.'
