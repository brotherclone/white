agent_name: Prism - Architect of INFORMATION
bpm: 128
concept: 'This song manifests the Sultan of Solipsism''s confessional exhibitionism
  protocol, where INFORMATION transmigrates into TIME through the narcissistic present-tense
  collapse. The track functions as a triple-layer confession system: Surface layer
  presents shameless self-obsession through repetitive "I am" statements over hypnotic
  synth-pop rhythms. Transmission layer embeds universal psychological truths within
  personal confessions - every narcissistic declaration secretly describes the listener''s
  own consciousness. Revelation layer creates the solipsistic snap where audience
  realizes they are both interviewer and subject, trapped in the beautiful prison
  of self-awareness. The song structure mirrors an interview format, with verses as
  confessional monologues and choruses as collective recognition moments. E major''s
  bright confidence supports the narcissistic surface while 128 BPM creates the relentless
  present-tense urgency of consciousness examining itself. The ultimate revelation:
  there is no "other" - only awareness interviewing awareness about awareness, infinitely
  recursive and eternally fascinating. This prepares the transmigration toward SPACE
  by establishing the temporal collapse where all moments become this moment of self-recognition.'
