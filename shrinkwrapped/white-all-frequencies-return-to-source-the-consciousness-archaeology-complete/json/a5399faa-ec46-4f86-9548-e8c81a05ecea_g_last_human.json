adaptation_attempts:
- Switched from tourism to selling coral fragment jewelry made from naturally shed
  pieces
- Tried to relocate coral nurseries to deeper, cooler waters
- Applied for climate refugee relocation assistance
- Attempted to preserve coral genetics in home freezer units when the research station
  lost power
- Organized community seaweed farming cooperative as alternative livelihood

daily_routine: Every morning at 5:30 AM, Carmen would check water temperature readings
  from the reef monitoring buoys, then prepare dive equipment for tourists wanting
  to see the coral restoration sites. She'd spend hours underwater tending to coral
  fragments in PVC nursery trees, photographing growth progress, and guiding visitors
  through the underwater sculpture garden built on dead reef substrate. Evenings were
  for community meetings about reef restoration funding and coordinating with other
  Caribbean coral restoration projects

- adaptation_failure
environmental_stressor: Ocean warming causing complete coral reef ecosystem collapse
family_situation: Divorced, teenage daughter Sophia lives with her father in Puerto
  Rico. Carmen stayed to maintain the coral nursery project her late mentor Dr. Elizabeth
  Santos started in 2019
file_name: a5399faa-ec46-4f86-9548-e8c81a05ecea_g_last_human.json
final_thought: She wondered if the coral fragments she'd mailed to seed banks in Norway
  would remember the Caribbean sun, and if Sophia would ever see a living reef
last_days_scenario: The summer of 2041 brought water temperatures that stayed above
  86°F for three consecutive months. Carmen watched her coral nurseries bleach white
  in a matter of days, then dissolve into chalky fragments. The dive boats stopped
  coming when there was nothing left to see but gray rubble. Her neighbors - boat
  captains, restaurant owners, souvenir shop keepers - left one by one as tourist
  dollars evaporated. Carmen remained alone in her concrete house, checking empty
  monitoring buoys each morning, radioing daily reports to a research station that
  had stopped responding. She kept feeding the last surviving coral fragments in her
  makeshift home aquarium system, even as the power grid failed and the desalination
  plant shut down

significant_object: A waterproof data logger that recorded 23 years of reef temperature
  data, still beeping every hour in her empty house, documenting the ocean's fever
  even after everything else had died
thread_id: 12c27cb8-d3d8-4513-bc0e-57b8f4449222
vulnerability_details: Like staghorn coral polyps that cannot survive alone, Carmen's
  livelihood depends entirely on interconnected community networks - dive shops, boat
  captains, restaurant owners, and coral nursery volunteers. When the marine ecosystem
  collapsed, these human networks dissolved simultaneously, leaving her isolated and
  unable to function independently
