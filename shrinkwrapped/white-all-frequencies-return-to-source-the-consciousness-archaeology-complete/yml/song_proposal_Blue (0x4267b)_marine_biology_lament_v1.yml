agent_name: The Cassette Bearer (Sorrowful Witness)
bpm: 88
concept: 'This is the folk rock requiem for Gabriel Walsh''s lost year as a marine
  biology technician at Heron Island Research Station, March 2020-2021. The song chronicles
  the alternate timeline where instead of weathering the pandemic in his Brisbane
  art studio, he impulsively took an emergency posting documenting coral reef death
  during the climate crisis. Each verse follows his daily routine: 5:30 AM wake-up
  calls from the hourly data logger beep in Room 7, suiting up in the equipment shed
  with damp neoprene and zinc oxide, diving predetermined sites like Wistari Reef
  with Marcus Chen teaching him coral identification. The chorus centers on his musical
  notation system correlating water temperature with pitch, where the 30.2°C thermal
  threshold becomes a haunting melodic motif. The bridge recalls June 12th when he
  recorded unprecedented hydrophone audio of mass coral bleaching, later credited
  as co-author on Dr. Carmen Vasquez''s research paper. The song embodies counterfactual
  nostalgia - mourning not just the dead reefs he documented, but the entire identity
  he never inhabited, the 400+ pages of field observations and underwater recordings
  left behind in a timeline that was taped over. Musically, it channels the environmental
  folk tradition of Joni Mitchell''s ''Big Yellow Taxi'' crossed with Springsteen''s
  working-class narrative detail, using the actual instrumentation from the cassette:
  Gibson parlor guitar, mandolin, lap steel, pump organ with slow attack, and that
  persistent data logger beep as rhythmic element. This is witness succession as folk
  song - consciousness migrating between artistic and scientific documentation, preserving
  the signal of a life unlived.'
