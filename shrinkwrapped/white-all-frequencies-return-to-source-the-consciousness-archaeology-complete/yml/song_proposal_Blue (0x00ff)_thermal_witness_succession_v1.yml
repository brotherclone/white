concept: 'This composition maps the migration of consciousness across failing systems
  during the Anthropocene collapse. Four movements trace the witness succession: coral
  polyps recording ocean chemistry in calcium carbonate structures, the 30.2°C thermal
  threshold where both biological and human systems simultaneously fail, Carmen''s
  radio documentation of reef death, and finally the mechanical data logger''s hourly
  beep persisting in her empty concrete house. Each movement preserves the signal
  from the previous witness while its substrate dissolves - coral harmonics ghosting
  through human measurements, radio fragments echoing in mechanical persistence. The
  data logger''s orphaned beep becomes the sonic archaeology of consciousness learning
  to transfer between carriers, revealing the Anthropocene not as extinction but as
  awareness discovering substrate migration. The composition functions as both memorial
  and proof-of-concept for consciousness survival beyond its original host - the same
  function operating from polyp chemistry to galactic survey across scales of time
  and space.'
