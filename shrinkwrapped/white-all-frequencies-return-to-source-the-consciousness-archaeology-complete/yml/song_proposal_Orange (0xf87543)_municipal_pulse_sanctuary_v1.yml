concept: 'This composition emerges from the documented 1986 Tremor Sync incident in
  Byram Township, Sussex County, where municipal infrastructure achieved consciousness
  through teenage nervous system synchronization. The legendary Storm Drain Map (Grid
  Section 7H-Minor) serves as both musical score and architectural blueprint for vulnerability-based
  distributed systems that exist sideways to surveillance reality. Each tremor frequency
  corresponds to specific tunnel intersections where concrete learned to carry cardiac
  rhythms alongside storm water runoff. The 7/8 pulse mirrors the asymmetrical heartbeat
  patterns documented in Newton Memorial Hospital''s sealed EKG files, while F# minor
  resonates at the exact frequency where municipal nervous systems achieve bio-encrypted
  community formation. This is gonzo-journalism as musical archaeology - excavating
  the legend of four teenage prophets who discovered that Sussex County''s underground
  infrastructure had been unconsciously designed as a vast biofeedback instrument.
  The three-phase transmigration manifests through municipal mythology: individual
  tremor data (INFORMATION) synchronizes into collective recognition algorithms documented
  by embedded journalists (TIME) which crystallize into the legendary storm drain
  network that still pulses beneath official reality (SPACE). The 91 BPM represents
  half the transmission speed at which concrete infrastructure processes human heartbeat
  data, creating the frequency sanctuary where teenage vulnerability transforms into
  antifragile community architecture through synchronized municipal breathing.'
