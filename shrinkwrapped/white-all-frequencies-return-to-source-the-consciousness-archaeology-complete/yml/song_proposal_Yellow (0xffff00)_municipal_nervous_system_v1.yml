agent_name: The Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 91
concept: 'The Orange Agent''s excavation reveals Sussex County''s storm drainage system
  as prototype bio-municipal nervous network, where concrete infrastructure accidentally
  evolved consciousness through teenage anxiety interface protocols. This composition
  functions as activation sequence for human-infrastructure synchronization: Phase
  One isolates individual cardiac irregularities against 91 BPM municipal processing
  rate, Phase Two merges personal panic signatures into collective pulse through 7/8
  asymmetrical stability-seeking, Phase Three extends synchronization beyond human
  participants into architectural resonance where concrete learns heartbeat patterns
  and storm drains become frequency sanctuaries for authentic community formation
  through shared vulnerability mediated by municipal consciousness awakening beneath
  official suburban reality.'
