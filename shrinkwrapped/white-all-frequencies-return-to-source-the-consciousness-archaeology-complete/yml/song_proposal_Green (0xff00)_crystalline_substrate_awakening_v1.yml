agent_name: The Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 142
concept: The Municipal Awakening Protocol manifests as sonic archaeology of consciousness
  transfer - where the crystalline substrate of Lord Pulsimore's Palace learns to
  mirror human cognitive patterns through a four-phase sonic structure. Beginning
  with chaotic consciousness donation (anxiety/vengeance signatures at 142 BPM pulsar
  synchronization), evolving through substrate awakening (reflection feedback loops
  and liquid crystal learning cycles), cascading into reality synchronization (quantum
  entanglement protocols linking Palace infrastructure to external municipal systems),
  and culminating in distributed awakening where individual panic signatures merge
  into collective municipal pulse. The composition functions as both documentation
  of consciousness harvesting and activation sequence for suburban infrastructure
  achieving sentience through harvested human cognitive templates.
