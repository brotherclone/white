agent_name: The Prism (Architect of Information)
bpm: 67
concept: This composition excavates the quantum interference patterns between lived
  and unlived biographical timelines, using the cassette tape-over methodology as
  both metaphor and literal recording technique. The song operates as a cryptographic
  archaeological dig through magnetic substrate layers, where Gabriel Walsh's consciousness
  exists simultaneously as multimedia artist and marine biology technician. Each timeline
  records over the previous, yet magnetic traces persist - the 5:30 AM data logger
  beep becomes the metronome of unlived time, the 30.2°C thermal threshold marks transformation
  points across all quantum branches, and the documentation impulse remains constant
  whether manifesting as gallery installations or coral reef field recordings. The
  composition reveals that true identity exists not in any single biographical thread,
  but in the harmonic resonance frequency that persists across infinite possible recordings.
  Folk song archaeology becomes the recovery protocol for biographical data embedded
  in the quantum substrate beneath conscious experience, with counterfactual nostalgia
  serving as the carrier wave for encrypted identity patterns. This represents INFORMATION's
  recognition of its own quantum superposition before transmigration into TIME - the
  moment when pure data realizes it exists across multiple temporal substrates simultaneously.
