text: 'BYRAM TOWNSHIP - Sussex County health officials are investigating a series
  of anxiety-related incidents among local teenagers that appear connected to an experimental
  rock band''s underground rehearsal sessions near Lake Lackawanna.


  The band, calling themselves "Tremor Sync," has been practicing in abandoned storm
  drains beneath the township since November, according to Byram police. Seven teenagers
  have been hospitalized since December for what doctors describe as "synchronized
  panic attacks" - episodes where multiple individuals experience identical physical
  symptoms simultaneously.


  "We had three kids come in last Tuesday, all exhibiting the same irregular heartbeat
  pattern," said Dr. Margaret Chen of Newton Memorial Hospital. "Their vital signs
  were fluctuating in perfect rhythm with each other. I''ve never seen anything like
  it."


  The incidents began after word spread among local high school students about the
  band''s unusual rehearsal space. Witnesses describe descending into the concrete
  tunnels to hear what they call "music that makes you shake in time with everyone
  else."


  Tremor Sync, comprised of four Byram Township High School dropouts, performs what
  lead vocalist Jamie Kellner describes as "frequency sanctuary music" - compositions
  played in unconventional time signatures designed to synchronize listeners'' nervous
  systems.


  "We''re not trying to hurt anyone," Kellner told the Independent. "We found this
  place where the acoustics do something weird to sound waves. People who come down
  there... they start breathing together, their hearts beat together. It''s like we''re
  all part of the same organism."


  The band''s equipment includes modified amplifiers that Kellner claims can produce
  "tremor frequencies" - specific sound waves that allegedly resonate with human nervous
  system patterns. Band members refuse to reveal the technical specifications of their
  modifications.


  Township officials discovered the rehearsal site after receiving noise complaints
  from residents near the storm drain entrances. However, police report that the sound
  is barely audible above ground, despite reaching significant volume levels within
  the tunnel system.


  "The strangest part is how the kids describe feeling simultaneously terrified and
  safe," said Byram Police Chief Robert Martinez. "They''re having panic attacks,
  but they don''t want to leave. They keep going back."


  Parents have expressed concern about what they describe as their children''s "obsession"
  with the underground performances. Several teenagers have been reported missing
  for hours at a time, only to be found emerging from storm drain grates across the
  township.


  "My daughter Sarah comes home shaking, but she says she feels more connected to
  people than ever before," said local parent Carol Brennan. "She''s been struggling
  with anxiety for years, but now she says she''s found others who ''vibrate at the
  same frequency.'' I don''t understand what that means."


  Mental health counselor David Roth, who has treated three of the affected teenagers,
  notes that while the panic attacks are genuine medical events, the patients report
  feeling "less alone" afterward.


  "There''s something about shared vulnerability that seems to be creating strong
  social bonds among these young people," Roth explained. "They''re forming what they
  call an ''underground community'' based on their shared experiences in those tunnels."


  The band''s bass player, who identified himself only as "Node," claimed the group
  discovered the location after experiencing what he described as "frequency gaps"
  - areas where standard radio and television signals become distorted.


  "Surveillance can''t reach down there," Node said. "Not electronic surveillance,
  not social surveillance. It''s like existing sideways to the normal world."


  Sussex County officials have declared the storm drain system off-limits pending
  a safety inspection. However, enforcement has proven difficult as the tunnel network
  extends throughout the township with numerous access points.


  As of Monday, Tremor Sync''s whereabouts remain unknown. Their equipment was found
  abandoned in the tunnels, but band members have not been seen since the township''s
  announcement of the investigation.


  The final teenager to be hospitalized, 17-year-old Marcus Webb, was found Sunday
  morning at a storm drain entrance, exhibiting what doctors described as "tremor
  patterns" in his hands that matched the rhythm of his heartbeat.


  "He keeps asking when the others are coming back," said Webb''s mother, Linda. "He
  says they''re all connected now, that they can feel each other even when they''re
  apart. I just want my son to be normal again."


  Township officials urge parents to monitor their teenagers'' whereabouts and report
  any suspicious underground activity to Byram police.'
