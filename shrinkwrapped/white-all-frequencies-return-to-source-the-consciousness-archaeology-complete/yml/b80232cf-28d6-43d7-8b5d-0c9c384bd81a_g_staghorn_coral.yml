anthropogenic_factors:
- Atmospheric CO2 levels exceeding 420ppm (2024)
- Ocean temperature increase 1.5°C above pre-industrial
- Agricultural runoff (nitrogen, phosphorus loading)
- Coastal development destroying mangrove nurseries
- Overfishing removing herbivorous fish that control algae
- Sunscreen chemicals (oxybenzone) in tourist areas

artifact_name: staghorn_coral
base_path: /Volumes/LucidNonsense/White/chain_artifacts
cascade_effects:
- Loss of reef structure - 3D habitat collapses to 2D rubble field
- 25% of all marine species lose critical habitat
- Caribbean fisheries collapse (600+ species depend on reef)
- Coastal erosion accelerates without reef wave-breaking
- Tourism economies collapse in 26 Caribbean nations
- Protein source for 100+ million people disappears

- Algae overgrowth from nutrient pollution
size_category: colonial/modular
symbolic_resonance:
- Colonial organism - individuals can't survive alone
- Builds structures that outlast individual polyps by centuries
- Death by fever (bleaching from temperature)
- Dissolving in the medium it evolved in (acidification)
- Killed by the atmosphere (CO2 absorption)
