bpm: 68
concept: This composition functions as sonic archaeology of simultaneous extinction
  - the thermal threshold where both Acropora cervicornis and human witness systems
  fail at precisely 30.2°C. The piece maps the gap between measurement and meaning,
  structured around the persistent beeping of a data logger continuing its documentation
  in an empty house above gray waters. Beginning with the underwater cathedral of
  living reef (staghorn branches reaching upward like antlers), transitioning through
  the fever dreams of bleaching (symbiotic algae expulsion as temperature crosses
  biological thresholds), cascading into structural dissolution (3D complexity collapsing
  to 2D rubble), and culminating in the memorial persistence of mechanical witness
  - the data logger's hourly pulse documenting absence. The composition preserves
  the specific quality of documentation continuing after both coral polyps and human
  observer have dissolved, leaving only the LED's red blink against walls where photographs
  show underwater forests that no longer exist. Signal persists in the gap between
  what was measured and what it meant.
