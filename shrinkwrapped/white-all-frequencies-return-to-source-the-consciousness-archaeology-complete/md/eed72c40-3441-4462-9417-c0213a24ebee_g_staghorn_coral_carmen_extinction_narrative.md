# Staghorn coral / Carmen Delgado-Vega

## Species Arc: Staghorn coral
Caribbean waters, 1980-2035. Temperature records. Population surveys. Bleaching events increasing in frequency and severity. Structural complexity measurements declining from 3.2m vertical relief to 0.1m rubble fields. Symbiotic algae expulsion at 29.5°C threshold. Colony fragmentation accelerating. Recruitment failure documented across 847 monitoring sites. Functional extinction declared when remaining fragments lose reproductive capacity.

## Human Arc: Carmen Delgado-Vega
Coral Bay, St. John, 2018-2041. Carmen's hands in salt water every day for twenty-three years. Teaching tourists to identify staghorn branches. Building coral nurseries with PVC trees. Watching dive boat schedules thin from daily to weekly to never. Neighbors leaving. Radio silence. The data logger beeping in an empty house, documenting fever no one will read.

## Parallel Moments

### 1. Six years before extinction
**Species:** 2029: Staghorn colonies across the Caribbean experience synchronized mass bleaching. Water temperatures reach 30.2°C, triggering symbiotic algae expulsion across 89% of remaining populations

**Human:** 2029: Carmen watches her coral nurseries turn bone white in three days. She radios the research station: 'They're all bleaching. Even the deep ones.' The water feels like bathwater against her wetsuit

*Connection: Both species and human experience simultaneous system failure when thermal thresholds are exceeded*

### 2. Four years before extinction
**Species:** 2031: Remaining staghorn fragments lose structural integrity. Wave action reduces complex 3D reef architecture to flat rubble fields. 600+ dependent species lose critical habitat

**Human:** 2031: The dive boats stop coming to Coral Bay. Carmen's neighbor Miguel closes his charter business and moves to Puerto Rico. The reef that once rose like an underwater cathedral now lies flat as a parking lot

*Connection: Structural collapse eliminates the foundation that supported entire communities*

### 3. Two years before extinction
**Species:** 2033: Sexual reproduction fails across all monitored staghorn populations. No successful spawning events recorded. Genetic diversity collapses to critical levels

**Human:** 2033: Carmen's daughter Sophia calls from Miami: 'Mom, there's nothing left there for you.' Carmen looks at her empty coral nursery frames and doesn't argue. The reef has stopped making babies

*Connection: Both lose the ability to reproduce their future, severing the connection between generations*

### 4. Final year
**Species:** 2035: Last confirmed staghorn coral fragments dissolve during Hurricane Helena. Calcium carbonate skeletons crumble into sand. Species declared functionally extinct

**Human:** 2035: Carmen finds the last coral fragment in her home aquarium has dissolved overnight. She holds the empty water in her cupped palms, tasting salt. The data logger beeps. She is the only one left to hear it

*Connection: Final dissolution - both coral and human witness become memory held in empty hands*

## Elegiac Quality
The narrative achieves memorial through precise documentation rather than sentiment - temperature readings, population counts, the specific sound of a data logger continuing its work in abandonment. Loss is measured in concrete terms: degrees Celsius, meters of structural complexity, the number of days between radio responses. The elegiac power emerges from the gap between scientific precision and human witness, between the coral's biological imperative to build and Carmen's stubborn insistence on recording what remains
