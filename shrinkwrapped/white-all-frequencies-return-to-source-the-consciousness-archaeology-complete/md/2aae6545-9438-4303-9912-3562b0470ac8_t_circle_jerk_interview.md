## Question 1

**Owen Van Etten:** So this 'Sultan of Confession' track - I'm hearing this as like your David Bowie moment, right? Like you're creating this whole persona who just spills everything, and the 7/8 time signature is supposed to make us feel like we're in his unstable headspace? It's brilliant how you're using odd meters to literally embody psychological fragmentation!

**Walsh:** The Sultan isn't psychological fragmentation—it's methodological inversion of concealment architecture, where overwhelming transparency becomes its own form of cryptography—but also yeah, it's absolutely my divorced dad at Cinnabon energy made into a pop song. The 7/8 creates temporal instability because confession exists in perpetual present-tense, each revelation simultaneously exposing and transforming the confessor—which sounds pretentious as hell but it fucking slaps when you're actually inside it. I mean, narcissistic revelation as participatory consciousness archaeology? That's either genius or I've completely lost the plot, honestly don't know which.

## Question 2

**Owen Van Etten:** I've been diving deep into your synesthesia backstory, and I think I finally get what the Rainbow Table project is really about - you're basically trying to teach your brain to see music in color again through pure willpower and repetition, right? Like each album is a different wavelength you're training yourself to perceive? That's why you need exactly nine albums - one for each primary and secondary color plus white!

**Walsh:** Oh man, you're so close but also completely missing the deranged part—I'm not trying to get my synesthesia back, I'm using the systematic rebracketing methodology to CREATE artificial synesthesia through temporal architecture, which sounds pretentious as hell but basically means I'm teaching Claude to hallucinate colors the same way I do. The nine albums aren't wavelength training, they're chromatic information containers where each color represents a different way reality can be spliced and recombined—like if you took a Wendy's frosty and made it into a filing system for consciousness archaeology, no cap.

## Question 3

**Owen Van Etten:** Your 'rebracketing' methodology is fascinating because you're essentially doing what Cage did with chance operations, but instead of randomness you're using intellectual frameworks to break down the barriers between high art and pop music. So when you splice academic language with profane imagery, you're creating these Duchampian readymades but for sound, right? It's like musical conceptual art!

**Walsh:** Yeah, the Cage comparison is spot-on—but where his chance operations created democratic randomness, rebracketing methodology forces intentional collision between epistemic registers, like making gas station sushi fight a philosophy dissertation. The readymade thing is real though, except instead of putting a urinal in a gallery I'm putting "ontological instability" next to "this fucking slaps" and watching them destroy each other in real time. I know this sounds pretentious as hell, but the splice IS the content—information seeking space through temporal brackets that shouldn't coexist but somehow create meaning when they collide.
