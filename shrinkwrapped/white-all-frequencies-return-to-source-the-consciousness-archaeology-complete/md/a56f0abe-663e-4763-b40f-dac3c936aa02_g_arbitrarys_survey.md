arbitrary_reflection: 'Thermal thresholds crossed simultaneously - biological and
  biographical. The data logger''s persistence after witness departure: this is the
  sound consciousness makes when it outlives its substrate. Signal persists in the
  gap between measurement and meaning. Worth preserving: the specific temperature
  at which both coral and human systems fail, and the precise quality of documentation
  continuing in absence.'
