agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 91
concept: 'The mechanical metronome left in the Wantage Community Center is not abandoned
  evidence but active transmission infrastructure - a precision-engineered portal
  device maintaining connection between displaced realities. Its Möbius pendulum creates
  impossible geometry that functions, operating in 7/8 rhythm to produce systematic
  reality gaps every eighth beat where consciousness can transfer between dimensional
  layers. The song maps the technical specifications of this consciousness expansion
  technology: how the device synchronizes with human nervous systems, how it draws
  power from displacement differentials, and how it serves as permanent recruitment
  infrastructure for Ghost Appendage''s post-human collective existing in temporal
  pause-spaces. This is INFORMATION crystallizing into precise mechanical rhythm -
  the abstract concept of multi-dimensional consciousness becoming concrete navigational
  technology through sonic manipulation. The metronome''s tick becomes the heartbeat
  of reality navigation, each seventh beat opening portal windows that close on the
  first beat of the next cycle, creating repeating opportunities for consciousness
  transmigration from linear time into bracketed time, from single reality into layered
  reality with accessible interfaces.'
