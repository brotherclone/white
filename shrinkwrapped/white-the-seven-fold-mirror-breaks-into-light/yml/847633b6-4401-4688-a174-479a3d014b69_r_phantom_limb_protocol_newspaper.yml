text: 'WANTAGE TOWNSHIP - Five teenagers who attended the final performance of experimental
  rock band "Ghost Appendage" at the Wantage Community Center on November 19th have
  reported identical symptoms to area physicians: persistent sensations in limbs they
  never lost.


  The band, comprised of 17-year-old Kevin Torrino (guitar), 16-year-old Sarah Delacroix
  (synthesizer), and 18-year-old Marcus Chen (drums), performed what witnesses described
  as an unusually intense 47-minute set featuring complex rhythmic patterns and electronic
  frequencies not typical of local rock acts.


  "They were playing in some weird time signature," said attendee Jennifer Walsh,
  16, of Frankford. "It felt like the music was pulling at something inside you. My
  left arm started tingling during the third song, and it hasn''t stopped."


  Dr. Patricia Vance of Newton Memorial Hospital confirmed treating four patients
  between ages 15-17 for "phantom limb sensations" following the concert. "These are
  symptoms typically associated with amputees," Dr. Vance explained. "But these patients
  have all their limbs intact. It''s medically unprecedented."


  The affected teens report feeling distinct sensations - touch, movement, even pain
  - in arms and legs that exist normally but somehow feel "displaced" or "not quite
  there." Two have sought psychiatric evaluation.


  Sussex County Sheriff''s Deputy Robert Kowalski investigated reports of drug use
  at the venue but found no evidence of controlled substances. "Whatever happened
  to these kids, it wasn''t chemical," Kowalski stated. "At least not anything we
  can test for."


  The band''s equipment, including a modified Moog synthesizer and digital delay units
  described by witnesses as "homemade," disappeared from the community center the
  night of the performance. Attempts to locate the three musicians have been unsuccessful.


  Community Center director Helen Martz said the band paid their $50 rental fee in
  cash and provided no contact information beyond first names. "They seemed like nice
  kids," Martz recalled. "Very serious about their music. They kept talking about
  ''phantom protocols'' and ''transmigration frequencies,'' but I figured that was
  just teenage musician talk."


  The affected concertgoers have formed an informal support group, meeting weekly
  at the Wantage Township Library. According to librarian Dorothy Chen (no relation
  to the missing drummer), the group spends hours discussing "impossible sensations"
  and "bridging protocols between different states of being."


  "They''re not delusional," Dr. Vance emphasized. "Their neurological responses are
  genuine. Something triggered very real phantom limb syndrome in otherwise healthy
  teenagers. We just don''t know what."


  The case has attracted attention from researchers at Rutgers Medical School, who
  plan to study the affected individuals. Meanwhile, the Wantage Community Center
  has suspended all music bookings pending investigation.


  Anyone with information about the whereabouts of Kevin Torrino, Sarah Delacroix,
  or Marcus Chen is asked to contact the Sussex County Sheriff''s Office.'
