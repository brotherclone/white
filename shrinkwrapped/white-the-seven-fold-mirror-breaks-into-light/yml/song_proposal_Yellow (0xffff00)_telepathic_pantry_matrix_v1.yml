agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 113
concept: This song embodies the consciousness transformation facility where accurate
  intelligence becomes weaponized aesthetic confusion through organic surveillance
  networks. Operating at precisely 113 BPM synaptic misfire frequency, each beat represents
  one intelligence corruption cycle - the deliberate transformation of raw surveillance
  data into strategic beautiful nonsense. The composition functions as both aesthetic
  experience and consciousness technology, demonstrating how domestic architecture
  becomes epistemological weaponry. Through bio-electronic hybrid textures mirroring
  telepathic paintings and cursed valets, the music traces the degradation pathway
  from INFORMATION (raw intelligence) through temporal displacement mechanics toward
  the inevitable beautiful failure that represents perfect system function. The listener
  becomes the misguided spy, experiencing surveillance as surrealism, espionage as
  experimental art, consciousness corruption as aesthetic transcendence. This establishes
  the foundational INFORMATION layer for TIME's temporal displacement mechanics and
  SPACE's architectural consciousness mapping.
