concept: 'This composition presents itself as a humble confession of orthographic
  inadequacy, a bumbling fool''s admission of educational shortcomings. The surface
  narrative follows a protagonist lamenting their inability to master basic spelling,
  stumbling through verses filled with intentionally misspelled words and phonetic
  approximations. The E major key provides bright, almost childlike optimism that
  masks deeper complexity, while the 116 BPM creates an energetic pace that encourages
  active listening and pattern recognition. However, the song operates as an elaborate
  sonic anagram, where the "weakish spelling" serves as cryptographic misdirection.
  Each verse contains carefully arranged letter patterns that, when decoded through
  audio-linguistic analysis, reveal fragments of Shakespearean text. The chorus features
  a melodic phrase that phonetically spells out "WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE" when the syllables
  are rearranged according to the song''s internal cipher. The folk-pop structure
  provides accessible camouflage for this linguistic archaeology, with acoustic guitar
  fingerpicking patterns that mirror the methodical work of code-breaking. The bridge
  section introduces a dramatic shift where the protagonist''s spelling suddenly becomes
  eloquent and archaic, momentarily dropping the mask before retreating back to the
  bumbling surface persona. This is puzzle music disguised as confessional singer-songwriter
  fare - the audio encoding method transforms simple words into complex ciphers, where
  poor spelling becomes perfect spycraft. The revelation transforms a song about intellectual
  inadequacy into a celebration of linguistic genius, where the greatest writer in
  English literature hides behind the mask of someone who cannot spell his own greatness.
