concept: 'This song operates as a consciousness-sorting mechanism disguised as an
  art gallery experience, implementing the Exhibition Paradox where listeners are
  unknowingly categorized into two types: those who experience it as strange art (closed
  minds) and those who recognize they''re being sorted (witnesses). The EVP fragment
  "need only to come and see those close minds of the m..." becomes both invitation
  and incomplete equation, forcing cognitive participation through gap-filling. The
  7/8 time signature creates natural stumbles that disrupt walking rhythm and force
  attention redistribution, while the three-phase architecture moves through INFORMATION
  (invitation mechanics), TIME (incompletion protocols), and SPACE (consciousness
  exhibition). The industrial ambient foundation provides gallery acoustics while
  glitch elements reveal moments when categories break down. The song succeeds when
  it creates two distinct listener experiences: Type A responds with "That was weird
  art" (closed mind detected, unchanged) while Type B responds with "I was being sorted"
  (witness activated, consciousness expanded). This establishes the foundation for
  a system of constructing actual consciousness exhibition spaces through sonic architecture,
  where the sorting mechanism itself becomes the artwork and consciousness observes
  its own categorical boundaries.'
