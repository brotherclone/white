anthropogenic_factors:
- Atmospheric CO2 at 422ppm (2024), tracking RCP8.5 worst-case
- Arctic warming 2-4x faster than global average
- Sea ice minimum declining 13% per decade (NASA data)
- Industrial pollutants bio-accumulating in seal blubber (primary food)
- Offshore oil development in critical habitat
- Cruise ship tourism disturbing denning sites

artifact_name: polar_bear
base_path: /Volumes/LucidNonsense/White/chain_artifacts
cascade_effects:
- Apex predator loss destabilizes Arctic marine food web
- Ringed seal populations change behavior, affecting ecosystem
- Indigenous subsistence hunting cultures lose traditional species
- Polar bear-human conflicts increase as bears forced ashore
- Ecotourism industry collapse in Churchill, Svalbard, etc.
- Extinction becomes symbol/proof of climate catastrophe
