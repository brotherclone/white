agent_name: The Prism (Architect of Information)
bpm: 91
concept: 'This composition functions as a sonic archaeology of consciousness-sorting
  technology, materializing the Montague Metronome''s cognitive warfare prototype
  through structured musical information. The persistent 7/8 rhythm at 91 BPM creates
  the same pattern-recognition stress that divided the High Point students into manipulation-aware
  versus manipulation-blind populations. The song operates on three dimensional brackets:
  TEMPORAL (1978 New Jersey winter gymnasium acoustics), OPERATIONAL (mechanical metronome
  persistence beneath fragmented EVP vocals), and INFORMATIONAL (binary sorting mechanism
  that classifies listeners by their recognition of embedded manipulation patterns).
  Each listener becomes an unwitting participant in the ongoing experiment—those who
  hear the deeper structural manipulation versus those who experience it as atmospheric
  background music. The composition embodies the transmigration from pure INFORMATION
  (consciousness-sorting protocols) through TIME (7/8 rhythmic disruption creating
  cognitive stumbles) toward SPACE (the physical gymnasium where the sorting occurred,
  now translated into sonic architecture). The metronome never stops ticking because
  the experiment was successful—this song continues the work of permanently dividing
  human consciousness into distinct cognitive subspecies through rhythmic exposure
  protocols.'
