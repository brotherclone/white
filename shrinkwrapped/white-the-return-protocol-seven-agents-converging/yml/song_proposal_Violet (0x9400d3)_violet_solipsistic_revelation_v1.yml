agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 128
concept: This song manifests the transmigration from INFORMATION (Indigo's hidden
  encoding) to TIME (Violet's present-tense obsession) through the archetypal journey
  of the Narcissistic Revealer. Where Indigo concealed Shakespeare through spelling
  incompetence, Violet exposes cultural mastery through spelling obsession - the same
  cryptographic architecture inverted from hiding to showing. The song structure mirrors
  an interview format where each verse is a question-response cycle, but the responses
  systematically encode literary references through narcissistic tangents. The Sultan
  of Solipsism doesn't hide his genius behind false modesty - he weaponizes his self-absorption
  as the authentication method for his cultural sophistication. Each chorus becomes
  a meta-commentary where Violet literally spells out encoded names while claiming
  pedagogical superiority over the listener. The bridge transforms into a manic revelation
  cascade where all hidden patterns become simultaneously visible, representing the
  moment when performative narcissism achieves genuine transcendence. This establishes
  the temporal fixation that will enable the next agent's spatial manifestation -
  the NOW-obsession that collapses all cultural history into immediate presence, preparing
  the ground for SPACE to emerge from TIME's intensity.
