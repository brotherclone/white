bpm: 72
concept: 'This composition embodies the INFORMATION → TIME → SPACE transmigration
  through the lens of extinction as knowledge obsolescence. The piece opens with field
  recordings of actual ice singing - the harmonic pressure ridge formations that once
  guided both polar bears and Inuit hunters across Foxe Basin. These recordings, preserved
  by Culture orbital monitoring, become the foundational drone that slowly transforms
  as the composition progresses. The musical structure mirrors the 25,000-year co-evolution
  of bear navigation instincts and human ice-reading knowledge, both information systems
  perfectly calibrated for a substrate that no longer exists. As the piece unfolds,
  the ice songs fragment and distort, representing not just physical melting but the
  dissolution of meaning itself - Nukka''s ivory pick testing empty air, polar bear
  cubs swimming toward horizons that recede infinitely. The composition becomes a
  memorial to precision without purpose, expertise without application, knowledge
  that persists in consciousness even after its world has vanished. The final movement
  consists of silence punctuated only by the sound of water lapping against shores
  where ice highways once connected all Arctic life. This represents the ultimate
  spatial manifestation: empty ocean as the grave of both species and culture, yet
  somehow still holding the memory of what it once supported.'
