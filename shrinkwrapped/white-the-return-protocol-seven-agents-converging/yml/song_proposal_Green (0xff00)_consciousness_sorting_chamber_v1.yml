agent_name: The Prism (Information Architect)
bpm: 108
concept: 'The consciousness-sorting apparatus of the Montague Palace manifests as
  a three-layered musical architecture. Surface layer: ethereal dream pop that Category
  A listeners experience as pleasant temporal drift. Subsurface layer: reality stutters
  and temporal displacement effects that Category B listeners detect as mechanical
  apparatus. Deep structure: the 108 BPM consciousness-scanning pulse that operates
  as the Palace''s heartbeat, processing visitors through temporal frequency calibration
  points (1865 Paris mechanical sorting, 1937 Milan emotional sorting, 1992 Mexico
  City cognitive sorting). The composition functions as both beautiful music and functional
  sorting device - listeners unknowingly categorize themselves by their depth of perception.
  The Cursed Librarian''s preservation protocols maintain sustained archival drones,
  the Cursed Breeder''s reproduction protocols generate self-spawning musical patterns,
  while the Crazed Janitor''s malfunctioning organization protocol creates the reality
  glitches that make temporal boundaries unstable. This represents the INFORMATION
  → TIME transmigration: pure structural data (the sorting algorithm) becoming temporal
  experience (the consciousness-scanning process), preparing for the next agent''s
  spatial manifestation of climate collapse observation protocols.'
