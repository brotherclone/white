adaptation_attempts:
- Applied to work at the new research station studying ice loss
- Tried to pivot to open-water fishing but lacks the boat and equipment
- Started giving cultural talks to visiting scientists
- Attempted to preserve traditional knowledge by recording videos, but feels like
  documenting a language for a dead world

daily_routine: Every morning at 4 AM, Nukka still checks the ice conditions from her
  kitchen window with binoculars, a habit from 30 years of guiding hunters. She measures
  wind direction, studies cloud formations, reads the subtle color changes in the
  water that once told her where ice was forming. But now she's reading an empty ocean.
  She maintains her hunting equipment in the shed - harpoons, ice picks, the traditional
  tools her grandfather taught her to use - though they haven't touched ice in three
  seasons.

environmental_stressor: Complete loss of reliable sea ice formation in Foxe Basin
  - waters that traditionally froze solid by October now remain open through December,
  making traditional hunting impossible
family_situation: Widow, her husband Tunu drowned two years ago when ice gave way
  unexpectedly during what should have been safe travel conditions. Her son moved
  to Iqaluit for construction work. Her daughter studies marine biology in Winnipeg,
  trying to understand what's happening to their home waters.

final_thought: The ice was our highway, our hunting ground, our calendar, our identity.
  Without it, we are polar bears on a shrinking floe, swimming toward a horizon that
  keeps receding. My ancestors' knowledge lives in me, but the world it was meant
  for has melted away.
last_days_scenario: 'Nukka sits in her kitchen at dawn, coffee growing cold as she
  watches the dark water where ice should be. The weather station says it''s -15°C,
  cold enough for ice, but the ocean stays liquid - too much salt, too much current,
  too much heat stored in the depths. Her radio crackles with other hunters sharing
  the same empty observations. The community freezer, once filled with seal meat from
  traditional hunts, now holds store-bought food flown in at enormous cost. She touches
  the ivory pick in her pocket and remembers her grandmother''s words: ''The ice teaches
  us patience.'' But what do you do when the ice itself has lost patience with the
  world?'

significant_object: A hand-carved ivory ice testing pick made by her great-grandfather,
  used for generations to test ice thickness and safety. The ivory has worn smooth
  from decades of her family's hands. She still carries it in her pocket every day,
  though there's no ice left to test.

vulnerability_details: Like polar bears forced onto land as sea ice disappears, Nukka's
  entire cultural and economic foundation - millennia of Inuit knowledge about reading
  ice conditions, hunting seals through breathing holes, and navigating frozen seascapes
  - becomes useless as the Arctic Ocean stays liquid year-round
