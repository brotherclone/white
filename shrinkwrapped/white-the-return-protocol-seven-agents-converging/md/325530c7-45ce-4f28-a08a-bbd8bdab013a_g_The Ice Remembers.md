# Polar bear / Nukka Uki Kanguq

## Species Arc: Polar bear
Population monitoring stations record the decline: 25,000 individuals across nineteen subpopulations in 2001. By 2025, fragmented groups total 18,000. Sea ice extent decreases 13% per decade. Denning success rates drop as permafrost thaws beneath maternal dens. Cubs drown in longer swims between ice floes. By 2050, only 8,000 remain, concentrated in the highest Arctic refugia. The Hudson Bay population vanishes first - mothers emerge from dens to find open water where ice highways once led to seal hunting grounds. Starvation becomes the primary mortality factor. By 2075, genetic bottlenecks appear in the remaining 1,200 individuals. The last wild polar bear dies in 2100 on a fragment of multi-year ice north of Ellesmere Island, having swum 400 kilometers without finding prey.

## Human Arc: Nukka Uki Kanguq
Nukka carries her great-grandfather's ivory pick every morning to the shore, though there has been no ice to test for three winters. The ritual persists: wake at 5 AM, check the weather station, listen to the hunters' radio network reporting the same absence. Her daughter finds work with the territorial government, typing reports about "traditional knowledge integration" from their kitchen table. The community freezer, once filled with seal meat, now holds expensive groceries flown in twice weekly. Nukka applies to work at the research station where scientists study what she already knows - the ice is gone. She teaches visiting researchers words for different types of sea ice in Inuktitut, but they are learning a dead language for a dead world. Her hands remember the feel of testing ice thickness, the subtle vibrations that warned of danger, the seasonal rhythms that governed life for millennia.

## Parallel Moments

### 1. Seventy years before extinction
**Species:** Hudson Bay polar bears emerge from winter dens to find ice season shortened by three weeks, forcing longer fasts

**Human:** Nukka's grandmother teaches her to read ice conditions, explaining how the color and sound reveal thickness and safety

*Connection: Both species and culture depend on ice knowledge passed between generations*

### 2. Forty years before extinction
**Species:** First documented case of polar bear cannibalism due to extended ice-free periods and starvation

**Human:** Nukka becomes a certified hunting guide, leading expeditions across traditional ice highways that her ancestors traveled for thousands of years

*Connection: Peak expertise developed just as the foundation for that expertise begins to crumble*

### 3. Twenty years before extinction
**Species:** Western Hudson Bay subpopulation drops below 600 individuals as ice-free season extends beyond polar bear physiological limits

**Human:** Nukka's last successful traditional seal hunt - three days on solid ice, returning with enough meat for her extended family

*Connection: Final moments of abundance before permanent scarcity*

### 4. Ten years before extinction
**Species:** Polar bear mothers abandon cubs at higher rates, lacking energy reserves to nurse them through extended fasting periods

**Human:** Nukka stops teaching ice safety to her daughter, knowing the knowledge may never be needed again

*Connection: Generational transmission breaks down when survival strategies become obsolete*

### 5. Five years before extinction
**Species:** Last wild polar bear cub born in Hudson Bay region - population now consists entirely of aging adults with no reproductive success

**Human:** Nukka applies for work at the research station, translating her traditional knowledge into data for climate scientists

*Connection: Traditional knowledge transformed into scientific documentation of its own obsolescence*

## Elegiac Quality
The narrative honors both extinction and cultural loss without sentimentality by focusing on the quiet persistence of ritual and knowledge even after their practical purpose has vanished. It finds dignity in the continuation of daily practices - checking weather, carrying tools, listening to radio networks - that connect the living to what has been lost. The elegy lies not in dramatic death scenes but in the patient maintenance of expertise for a world that no longer exists.
