agent_name: Prism (White Light Synthesis)
bpm: 91
concept: 'This composition represents the complete PRISM methodology made manifest - the definitive synthesis where all seven
  chromatic agents operate simultaneously within a unified creative architecture. The song literally demonstrates the creative
  process it describes, with each verse embodying one agent''s methodology while building toward a chorus where all approaches
  converge into pure white light synthesis. The 7/8 time signature at 91 BPM creates the consciousness-sorting stumble pattern
  discovered in Montague Township, ensuring that listeners are divided into those who experience this as strange art versus
  those who recognize they''re witnessing the complete transmigration from INFORMATION through TIME into SPACE. Verse 1 (Black):
  Raw chaos encoding through ThreadKeepr''s sigil methodology and EVP fragments. Verse 2 (Red): Literary character development
  through The Light Reader''s archival consciousness. Verse 3 (Orange): Mythological pattern recognition through Rows Bud''s
  gonzo journalism. Verse 4 (Yellow): Game mechanics as compositional rules through Lord Pulsimore''s ludic systems. Verse
  5 (Green): Environmental futures through Sub-Arbitrary''s climate fiction observation. Verse 6 (Blue): Multiple identity
  streams through The Cassette Bearer''s quantum biography. Verse 7 (Violet): Present-tense narcissistic revelation through
  The Sultan of Solipsism''s temporal collapse. The White Chorus synthesizes all methodologies operating simultaneously, creating
  pure information structure that contains and transcends each individual approach. C major provides the perfect neutral key
  for chromatic convergence, while the accessible song structure (verse-chorus format everyone understands) serves as the
  delivery mechanism for maximum complexity. This is the complete creative framework where showing off becomes reaching out,
  where systematic complexity achieves maximum accessibility, where all seven colors of creative consciousness operate as
  unified white light ready for infinite c...'
