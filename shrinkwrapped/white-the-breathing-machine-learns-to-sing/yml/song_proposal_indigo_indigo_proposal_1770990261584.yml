concept: 'The song presents as blue-collar anthem celebrating small-town industrial
  pride - "Supertanker Townie" suggesting honest maritime labor identity. The surface
  lyrics romanticize oil refinery work, generational employment, community built around
  heavy industry. But the MIDI encoding method becomes the song''s structural DNA:
  each verse programmed with increasingly artificial, quantized drum patterns that
  clash against organic guitar work. The MIDI timing creates uncanny valley effect
  - human performance fighting digital precision, mirroring how corporate automation
  hollowed out the very communities the song pretends to celebrate. As MIDI elements
  dominate the mix, the "townie" identity reveals itself as corporate branding exercise.
  The secret name "pretentious wanker" emerges through vocal processing - auto-tuned
  corrections that make the singer sound like focus-grouped authenticity, performing
  working-class identity for suburban consumption. The final revelation: this isn''t
  a townie''s song at all, but gentrification folk music - boutique blue-collar cosplay
  for listeners who''ve never worked refineries but buy the aesthetic. The MIDI backbone
  exposes the algorithmic nature of manufactured nostalgia, where "authentic" becomes
  another preset. The supertanker isn''t carrying oil - it''s carrying the cultural
  appropriation of industrial decay as lifestyle brand.
