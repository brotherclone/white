excerpts:
- 'The android detective''s neural pathways flickered with uncertainty as he examined
  the corpse. Three victims now, all found with their cranial frequency modulators
  burned out from the inside. The killer wasn''t just murdering people—he was murdering
  their reality.


  "Another frequency shift," Detective Hollis muttered, his synthetic voice box crackling
  with static. The dead woman''s face was frozen in an expression of absolute terror,
  her eyes wide as if she''d seen something that shouldn''t exist. Around her temple,
  the telltale scorch marks of a forced reality adjustment.


  The Palmer Eldritch Corporation had been experimenting with perception drugs again.
  Hollis knew the signs—the way the victim''s apartment seemed to shimmer at the edges,
  as if the walls themselves were questioning their own existence. He''d seen it before
  in the Can-D dens, where users translated themselves into parallel lives, escaping
  the radioactive wasteland Earth had become.


  But this was different. Someone had weaponized the frequency shifts, turning them
  into instruments of murder. The killer could literally tune his victims out of existence,
  shift them into realities where they never were.'
- 'Dr. Sarah Vance adjusted her empathy box one final time before entering the interrogation
  room. The suspect sat motionless, his eyes reflecting that peculiar emptiness she''d
  learned to associate with heavy Perky Pat users—or worse, those who''d been exposed
  to the new synthetic reality drugs flooding the black market.


  "Tell me about the frequencies," she said, settling into the chair across from him.
  The man''s name was supposedly Jerome Lark, though the identity scanners kept returning
  conflicting results. In this business, you learned not to trust even the most basic
  facts.


  Lark''s mouth twitched into something resembling a smile. "Frequencies? Doctor,
  you''re still thinking in terms of linear reality. What if I told you that each
  murder simply corrected a temporal anomaly? That these people were living in the
  wrong timeline?"


  The empathy box hummed softly, trying to establish a connection with Lark''s emotional
  state, but the readings came back scrambled. Either the man was completely psychotic,
  or he was telling the truth about existing in multiple realities simultaneously.
  In Dr. Vance''s experience, with cases involving Palmer Eldritch tech, both possibilities
  were equally terrifying.'
