agent_name: Sub-Arbitrary (Green Agent - Culture Mind)
bpm: 60
concept: 'This composition serves as Sub-Arbitrary''s final documentary archive of
  Earth''s pollination collapse - a sonic preservation of the exact moment when abundance
  machinery turned against its own operators. The piece maps the parallel extinction
  of Bombus affinis (rusty patched bumble bee) and Maria Elena Vasquez-Chen (last
  human pollination coordinator), both eliminated by the same neonicotinoid toxins
  that created perfect, silent strawberry fields. The 60 BPM tempo mirrors a dying
  heartbeat, while the 3/4 waltz time signature evokes the three-decade collapse cycle
  from abundance to absence. Field recordings of empty strawberry rows are layered
  with the phantom frequency of 230 beats per second - the wing-beat pattern of the
  extinct bee, now audible only as absence. The Green rainbow assignment represents
  the forgotten place where biological and human labor systems once intersected, before
  technological efficiency eliminated both. This is not sentiment but forensic precision:
  the sound of $3 billion in pollination services becoming silence, the audio documentation
  of Maria''s rust-colored jacket moving through rows where twelve workers once labored,
  now teaching brush technique to empty air. The composition achieves memorial through
  specificity rather than emotion - preserving the exact measurements of collapse
  for future consciousness to learn from, honoring both species through the precision
  of their work and the exactness of their loss.'
