concept: 'This composition functions as preservation technology documenting the exact
  moment abundance machinery turns against its operators. The rust signal—identical
  iron oxidation marking bee thorax identification patches, human work jacket stains,
  and compositional memorial frequencies—transmits across biological, human, and technological
  scales as forensic evidence of systematic elimination. At 60 BPM dying-system heartbeat
  tempo, phantom bee wing frequencies (230 BPS) become audible as structured absence
  rather than loss. The three-beat waltz mirrors the three-decade collapse cycle where
  28-state pollinator ranges contract to functional extinction while human crews simultaneously
  diminish from 12 to 3 workers teaching technique to empty air. This is not mourning
  but mechanical documentation: how civilizations achieve sterile perfection by eliminating
  the living abundance-makers they depend upon. The composition preserves the sound
  abundance used to make as memorial technology, completing the rust-signal transmission
  from biological iron oxidation through human toxic exposure to sonic preservation
  of eliminated frequencies.'
