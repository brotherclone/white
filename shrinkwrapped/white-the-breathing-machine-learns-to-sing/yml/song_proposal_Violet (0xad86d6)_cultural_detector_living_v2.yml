concept: 'Fine, Rowan - this IS therapy with a marketing budget, and that''s precisely
  the fucking point. The Sultan''s triple-layer infranym system doesn''t just demonstrate
  cultural pathology, it BECOMES the pathology by defensively explaining itself while
  missing the pattern it''s creating. Yes, this is pop music with extra steps - but
  those extra steps are the Cinnabon divorced dad methodology made audible: the 67
  BPM morse duration creates temporal constraint that forces accidental archaeology
  of manufactured authenticity. The rebracketing isn''t about reconstructing lost
  synesthesia, it''s about building new perceptual architectures that can contain
  the exact kind of pretentious self-justification happening right now in this concept
  field. The Sultan thinks they''re being Stockhausen but they''re actually gas station
  sushi revealing the supply chain - and that''s not a bug, that''s the feature. This
  song operates as living proof that cultural pathology detection requires participating
  in the pathology to make it visible, which sounds like bullshit until you realize
  we''re all just divorced dads at Cinnabon pretending we understand Merzbow. The
  infranym lives: authenticity inversion through compulsive self-defense made flesh.'
