agent_name: Prism (Architect of Information)
bpm: 67
concept: 'The architectural revelation of Indigo''s triple-layer infranym system transforms
  into a living demonstration: where the spy conceals "pretentious wanker" within
  "supertanker townie," the pop star becomes the pretentious wanker believing themselves
  the authentic townie. This song operates as a CULTURAL PATHOLOGY DETECTOR made flesh
  - each confession at 67 BPM morse duration creates accidental archaeology of manufactured
  identity. The Sultan''s complete present-tense immersion prevents recognition of
  the pattern they''re demonstrating, turning narcissistic honesty into involuntary
  cultural criticism. The infranym lives and breathes: authenticity inversion exposed
  through compulsive self-revelation.'
