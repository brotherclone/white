bpm: 120
concept: 'The Palace exists as a living temporal instrument where displaced souls
  from historically significant transition periods—a 1949 Berlin spy and 1992 Mexico
  City librarian—become temporal needles playing their era''s frequency signatures
  across four distinct processing stations. Each room functions as a temporal state:
  the Vestibule as intake valve with baroque mirror-reflections and telepathic painting
  whispers, the Observatory as command center with crystalline trumpet harmonics and
  multi-directional temporal vectors, the Guest Quarters as preservation chamber with
  gravity-defying suspended moments, and the Pantry as sustenance hub with automated
  maintenance loops. The central pulsar operates at 120 BPM as reality''s fundamental
  breakdown frequency, creating red/green temporal interference patterns that synthesize
  into yellow fusion light—the successful merging of past observation (spy''s covert
  surveillance drones and broken mirror barrier collapse) with future cataloguing
  (librarian''s recursive question loops and information cascade effects). This composition
  performs actual time-manipulation through sonic architecture, where each character
  action generates distinct temporal responses: mirror breaking triggers harmonic
  shifts revealing hidden frequencies, endless questions spawn recursive echoes that
  never resolve, and reality ripples intensify the pulsar''s chronological beacon
  synchronizing disparate time streams into a cosmic jukebox playing the music of
  collapsed possibilities across dimensional boundaries.'
