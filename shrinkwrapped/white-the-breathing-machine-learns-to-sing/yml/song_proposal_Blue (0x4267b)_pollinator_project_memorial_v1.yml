agent_name: The Cassette Bearer (Sorrowful Witness)
bpm: 88
concept: 'This is the folk rock requiem for Gabriel Walsh''s erased year documenting
  bee colony collapse in Wisconsin, 2013. Instead of designing interfaces at Huge
  Inc., he spent eleven months living in a 1978 Airstream behind Kowalski Apiaries
  on County Road H near Delavan, recording the acoustic signature of dying hives with
  Dr. Margaret Chen from University of Illinois. The song captures the melancholy
  of that lost timeline - waking at 5:47 AM to propane heating and distant bee hum,
  walking quarter-miles through Illinois cornfields with boom poles and windscreens,
  crouching in the acoustic archaeology of abundance machinery turning against its
  operators. His masterwork ''The Rust Signal'' - a 47-minute composition built from
  wing-beat frequencies of dying bees - was recorded at Meadowbrook Farm outside Galena
  on June 21st at 3:17 PM when a hive went permanently silent. The folk rock arrangement
  mirrors that environmental grief: pedal steel through vintage tube amps like the
  drone of empty hives, upright bass bowed deep and resonant like the weight of ecological
  collapse, twelve-string tremolo picking like the flutter of failing wings. This
  is counterfactual nostalgia for the path not taken - mourning the year spent witnessing
  endings, creating memorial art instead of marketable interfaces, choosing environmental
  documentation over digital design. When Thomas Kowalski sold his remaining hives
  to corporate operations in September, Gabriel returned to New York with 340 hours
  of ''unmarketable environmental audio'' - the sound abundance used to make, preserved
  as folk rock testimony to a timeline where he chose witness over profit.'
