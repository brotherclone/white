bpm: 67
concept: 'This composition excavates the emotional archaeology of biographical quantum
  branching through the Palimpsest Method - where unlived timelines become more emotionally
  authentic than actual experience. The cassette format serves as temporal encryption
  device, recording over previous realities while preserving their frequency bleed-through.
  Each verse functions as a sedimentary layer of counterfactual specificity: Gabriel''s
  5:47 AM wake-up calls in the Airstream trailer, Dr. Chen''s spectral analysis of
  dying bee colonies, the 340 hours of unmarketable environmental audio that becomes
  folk rock testimony. The rust signal of ecological collapse transmigrates through
  tape-over protocol into biographical cipher keys - hyperspecific details that feel
  archaeologically excavated rather than invented. This creates the documentary fiction
  infrastructure where INFORMATION (environmental data) passes through TIME (counterfactual
  biography) to manifest in SPACE (folk rock memorial architecture). The song mourns
  not just the paths not taken, but the entire methodology of witnessing collapse
  through intimate acoustic documentation.'
