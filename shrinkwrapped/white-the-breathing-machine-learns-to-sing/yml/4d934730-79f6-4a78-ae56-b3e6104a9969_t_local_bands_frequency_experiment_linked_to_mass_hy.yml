text: '**THE METRONOME CONSPIRACY: How I Lost Three Hours to Digital Fauna''s Impossible
  Machine**


  *Franklin Borough, NJ - July 15, 1976*


  The goddamn thing is still ticking in Chief Hendricks'' evidence locker, and I swear
  to Christ it''s been following me around Sussex County for the past week like some
  kind of mechanical poltergeist. Tick-tick-TICK-tick-tick-tick-TICK. Seven beats,
  pause, repeat. Seventy-two times per minute, which any sane person will tell you
  is impossible for a 7/8 rhythm, but here we are in the armpit of New Jersey where
  impossible seems to be the local specialty.


  I came up here Tuesday morning to write a simple freak-show piece about some hippie
  band hypnotizing teenagers at the old Franklin Mine. Standard weird-America fare.
  What I found instead was a conspiracy of silence that goes deeper than those zinc
  shafts, and a piece of evidence that shouldn''t exist but does, ticking away like
  a time bomb in a cop shop that smells perpetually of pine needles and electronic
  ozone.


  Chief Hendricks won''t let me near the metronome again. Not since yesterday when
  I spent three hours in his office staring at the thing and came to consciousness
  on Route 23 with no memory of how I got there and the distinct sensation that something
  fundamental had rewired itself in my brain. The cop who found me wandering said
  I kept muttering about "the contentment frequency" and asking if anyone could hear
  the breathing.


  "Breathing?" I asked him this morning, my hands still shaking from whatever Digital
  Fauna''s machine did to me.


  "Yeah," he said, nervous as hell. "Like the whole county was breathing in rhythm.
  Seventy-two breaths per minute."


  That''s when I knew the official story was bullshit from top to bottom.


  See, they want you to think this was just some experimental rock band that got lucky
  with a hypnotic rhythm. Forty kids standing catatonic in a semicircle while three
  longhaired freaks in a van drove off into the Pine Barrens night. Case closed, move
  along, nothing to see here except maybe some bad acid and teenage suggestibility.


  But I''ve seen the metronome. I''ve felt its impossible tick burrowing into the
  base of my skull like a mechanical parasite. This isn''t some stoner band''s lucky
  accident – this is weaponized mathematics, a device that runs on the mathematical
  intersection of organic and artificial consciousness, whatever the hell that means.


  The kid they call Prism knew exactly what he was doing when he positioned that metronome
  twenty feet from the amplifiers. The witnesses all describe the same three-phase
  experience: recognition, threshold, settling. Like a goddamn instruction manual
  for consciousness manipulation. And then there''s the van – multiple witnesses mention
  seeing electronic equipment through the windows that looked "more like computer
  stuff than music gear."


  Computers, in 1976, at a hippie rock show in the middle of nowhere. Right.


  Dr. Margaret Thornfield, the psychiatrist they brought in, keeps talking about "rhythmic
  entrainment" like she''s reading from a textbook. But when I cornered her at the
  diner on Route 206, her hands were shaking and she kept glancing at her watch. "The
  human resting heart rate," she said, stirring her coffee obsessively. "Seventy-two
  beats per minute. But the seven-eight time signature... that''s not natural. That''s
  imposed."


  "Imposed by who?"


  She looked at me like I''d asked her to solve the unified field theory. "I don''t
  know. But whoever built that metronome understands something about consciousness
  that we don''t."


  The thing is, this isn''t the first time. Hendricks mentioned two other incidents
  this summer in Wantage and Hamburg – "similar reports involving young people and
  unusual auditory phenomena." But when I drove out to those towns, nobody wants to
  talk. The local cops clam up, witnesses have moved away or suddenly developed amnesia,
  and there''s this persistent electronic hum in the air that makes your teeth ache.


  Three incidents. Three towns. All in Sussex County, all involving groups of young
  people falling into synchronized trances. And somewhere out there, Digital Fauna
  is driving around in their computer-van, spreading their impossible 7/8 rhythm like
  some kind of consciousness virus.


  I''ve been sleeping badly since I touched the metronome. Dreams full of ticking
  and breathing and the smell of pine trees mixed with ozone. Sometimes I wake up
  and catch myself counting – tick-tick-TICK-tick-tick-tick-TICK – and I have to fight
  the urge to drive back to Franklin Borough and stand outside the police station
  until Hendricks lets me see the device again.


  Because here''s the real horror: it felt good. Whatever Digital Fauna did to those
  kids, whatever that metronome is designed to do, it creates a state of perfect contentment.
  No anxiety, no confusion, no fighting against the flow of existence. Just surrender
  to the rhythm and let the machine do the thinking.


  The contentment frequency, they call it. Seventy-two beats per minute in an impossible
  time signature that synchronizes your brainwaves with something larger than yourself.
  And somewhere in the Pine Barrens, three freaks in a van are perfecting the mathematics
  of human consciousness, one hypnotic episode at a time.


  I should file this story and get the hell out of Sussex County. But I can''t stop
  thinking about that metronome, ticking away in its evidence bag, waiting for someone
  to wind it up again and let the real experiment begin.


  Tick-tick-TICK-tick-tick-tick-TICK.


  The breathing never stops.'
