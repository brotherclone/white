text: 'FRANKLIN BOROUGH - A Sussex County rock band''s experimental performance at
  the abandoned Franklin Mine site Monday evening resulted in what witnesses describe
  as a "mass hypnotic episode" affecting approximately 40 teenagers and young adults.


  The incident began around 9:30 PM when the three-piece group "Digital Fauna" set
  up equipment near the old zinc mine entrance for what band members called a "consciousness
  frequency test." According to police reports, the band had been experimenting with
  what they termed "bio-digital rhythm patterns" - musical compositions designed to
  synchronize with natural brainwave frequencies.


  "They started playing this really weird time signature," said witness Karen Molloy,
  17, of Hardyston Township. "It wasn''t like normal rock music. It was hypnotic,
  like a heartbeat but wrong somehow. People just started swaying and then... stopped
  moving entirely."


  Franklin Borough Police Chief Robert Hendricks confirmed that when officers arrived
  at approximately 10:15 PM, they found nearly four dozen individuals standing motionless
  in a semicircle around the band''s equipment. "They weren''t unconscious, but they
  weren''t responding to verbal commands either," Hendricks stated. "It was like they
  were all listening to something we couldn''t hear."


  The band''s lead member, who identified himself only as "Prism," claimed the group
  had been researching "the mathematical intersection of organic and artificial consciousness."
  When pressed for details, he described their music as operating in 7/8 time at exactly
  72 beats per minute - a rhythm he insisted matched "the natural contentment frequency
  of awakening awareness."


  Dr. Margaret Thornfield, a psychiatrist consulted by police, noted that 72 BPM corresponds
  to the human resting heart rate. "There''s documented research into rhythmic entrainment
  - the tendency for biological systems to synchronize with external rhythms," she
  explained. "But I''ve never seen anything quite like this mass response."


  The affected individuals gradually returned to normal awareness over a 45-minute
  period, with most reporting feelings of "deep calm" and "rhythmic dissolution."
  Several described experiencing what they called "three phases" during the episode:
  initial recognition of an unusual presence, a threshold moment of transformation,
  and finally a settling into what one witness described as "infinite cyclical breathing."


  More troubling for authorities is that no one present can clearly recall the band''s
  actual music. "I remember the feeling more than the sound," said witness Thomas
  Chen, 19. "It was like my consciousness just... stopped fighting and found its natural
  rhythm."


  The band packed their equipment and departed before police could conduct a thorough
  interview. Their vehicle, described as a modified van with unusual electronic equipment
  visible through the windows, was last seen heading north on Route 23.


  Chief Hendricks has issued a public advisory against attending unauthorized musical
  performances, particularly those involving "experimental frequencies." The Franklin
  Mine site, already restricted due to safety concerns, will receive increased patrols.


  Digital Fauna''s current whereabouts remain unknown. Anyone with information about
  the group or similar "frequency experiments" is asked to contact Franklin Borough
  Police.


  The incident marks the third unexplained group behavioral episode in Sussex County
  this summer, following similar reports in Wantage and Hamburg townships involving
  young people and unusual auditory phenomena.'
