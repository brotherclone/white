excerpts:
- 'The morning fog rolled in from the Pacific like a gray conspiracy, swallowing the
  docks whole. Somewhere in that maritime murk, between the creaking of rusted chains
  and the diesel wheeze of tugboats, Oedipa Maas found herself staring at a shipping
  manifest that shouldn''t exist. The Port of Last Resort—that''s what the longshoremen
  called this stretch of Terminal Island when they thought nobody was listening. But
  somebody was always listening in Los Angeles, 1963, and the somebody today was a
  middle-aged housewife from Kinneret who''d stumbled into an inheritance that felt
  more like a curse.


  The manifest bore the letterhead of Thurn und Taxis Enterprises, a company that
  according to her lawyer had been defunct since the Holy Roman Empire. Yet here were
  bills of lading for cargo that arrived on ships with no names, destined for addresses
  that existed only in the margins of Thomas Pynchon''s fevered imagination. She traced
  her finger down the list: "Fifty crates, misc. entropy." "One gross, left-handed
  cigarettes." "Seventeen barrels, pre-war silence."


  The fog pressed closer, and Oedipa felt the weight of conspiracy settling on her
  shoulders like a damp coat. This was how it always began—with a document that made
  no sense, in a place that shouldn''t exist, witnessed by people who might not be
  real.'
- 'Dr. Hilarius adjusted his wire-rimmed spectacles and consulted the notebook that
  never left his possession. The notebook contained what he called his "therapeutic
  observations," though Oedipa suspected it was really a ledger of human misery, carefully
  catalogued and cross-referenced. Today''s entry would be particularly interesting.


  "You see, Mrs. Maas," he said, his accent still thick with the weight of old Europe,
  "paranoia is not a disease—it is an adaptation. In a world where every surface conceals
  another surface, where every answer breeds three new questions, the paranoid mind
  is simply... how do you say... keeping up with the times."


  The office smelled of antiseptic and old leather, but underneath lurked something
  else—the metallic tang of fear, perhaps, or the ozone scent that precedes a storm.
  Through the window, she could see the Port of Last Resort shrouded in its perpetual
  fog, and she wondered if Hilarius could see it too, or if she was the only one cursed
  with this particular vision.


  "Tell me about the Tristero," he said, his pen poised above the notebook. "Tell
  me about the muted post horn you''ve been seeing. Tell me about the conspiracy that
  may or may not exist, and why that uncertainty terrifies you more than the certainty
  of either truth would."


  Outside, a ship''s horn sounded—three long blasts that seemed to echo from somewhere
  beyond the visible world.'
