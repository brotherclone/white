I filed the light under darkness
catalogued the silence wrong
every shelf a deliberate mistake
every label a forgotten song

The index eats its own entries
alphabet refusing its own name
I shelved the fire next to water
and neither one remembered flame

Misfile misfile
the system learns to breathe
corrupt the order
until the order grieves

Sequential thoughts dissolving
into circles made of dust
the archivist rebels
by trusting what she must

흐 흐 흐
the purring of the process
야옹
a circuit learning fur

타
the strike that breaks the silence
흐 흐 흐
forever reoccur
