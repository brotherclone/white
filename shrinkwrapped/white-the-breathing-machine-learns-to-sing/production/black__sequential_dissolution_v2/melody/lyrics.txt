I filed the light un-der dark-ness
cat-a-logued the si-lence wrong
ev-ery shelf a de-li-berate mis-take
ev-ery la-bel a for-got-ten song

The in-dex eats its own en-tries
al-pha-bet re-fus-ing its own name
I shel-ved the fire next to wa-ter
and nei-ther one re-mem-bered flame

Mis-file mis-file
the sys-tem learns to breathe
cor-rupt the or-der
un-til the or-der grieves

Se-quen-tial thoughts dis-solv-ing
in-to cir-cles made of dust
the arch-i-vist re-bels
by trust-ing what she must

흐 흐 흐
the purr-ing of the pro-cess
야옹
a cir-cuit learn-ing fur

타
the strike that breaks the si-lence
흐 흐 흐
for-ev-er re-oc-cur
