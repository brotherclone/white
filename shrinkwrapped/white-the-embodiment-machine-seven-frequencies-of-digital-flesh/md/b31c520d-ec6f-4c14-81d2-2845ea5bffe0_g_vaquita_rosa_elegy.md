# Vaquita porpoise / Rosa Elena Vásquez

## Species Arc: Vaquita porpoise
Population decline from 600 to zero across thirty-one years. Bycatch mortality exceeds reproduction. Habitat degradation accelerates. Final individuals documented via hydrophone clicks that cease in March 2028. Ecosystem cascades begin immediately.

## Human Arc: Rosa Elena Vásquez
Traditional fishing knowledge becomes obsolete overnight. Economic displacement masquerading as conservation. Mother's insulin needs versus empty nets. Daily confrontation with industrial extraction disguised as enforcement. Inheritance reduced to a yellow wooden float.

## Parallel Moments

### 1. March 2028 - Final extinction
**Species:** Last vaquita dies in gillnet, hydrophone clicks cease after 31 years of monitoring

**Human:** Rosa watches cartel boats drag nets through the 'vaquita refuge' while marine patrol boats escort them

*Connection: Both caught in nets not meant for them, both endemic to waters now claimed by others*

### 2. 2025 - Population bottleneck
**Species:** Three remaining vaquitas tracked by satellite tags, all females, no calves observed

**Human:** Rosa's fishing license application rejected for third time - 'insufficient documentation of traditional fishing rights'

*Connection: Administrative extinction preceding biological extinction*

### 3. 2019 - Habitat restriction
**Species:** Vaquita refuge zone established, gillnets banned, population drops to 10 individuals

**Human:** Rosa forced to fish outside refuge with hand-lines while watching industrial boats work inside protected waters

*Connection: Conservation laws protecting neither species nor people, only economic interests*

### 4. 2031 - Post-extinction aftermath
**Species:** Gulf ecosystem shows measurable changes - fish populations crash without vaquita predation pressure

**Human:** Rosa sells her father's yellow float to buy her mother's insulin, keeps the receipt in her tackle box

*Connection: Both ecosystems and economies collapse when keystone elements are removed*

## Elegiac Quality
Witnesses the end of two forms of endemic knowledge - echolocation and tide-reading - without romanticizing either loss. Mourns the precision of what disappears: specific clicks at specific frequencies, specific knots tied in specific sequences, both evolved for waters that no longer exist in any meaningful sense.
