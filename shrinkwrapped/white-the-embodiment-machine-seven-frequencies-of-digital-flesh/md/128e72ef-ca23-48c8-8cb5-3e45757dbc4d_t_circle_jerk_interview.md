## Question 1

**Nora Albini:** Okay, so I've been diving deep into your whole synesthesia thing, and I'm fascinated by how you're using the Sultan of Solipsism as like... a musical time machine? Like, are you literally trying to interview your way back to seeing purple again? Because the way you describe this 'eternal interview' format - it sounds like you're creating some kind of sonic séance to commune with your pre-medication brain!

**Walsh:** The rebracketing methodology transforms temporal displacement into sonic archaeology—which sounds absolutely deranged when I say it out loud, but also it fucking works. The Sultan isn't interviewing his way back to purple; he's creating a feedback loop where past neurochemistry becomes present architecture through narcissistic compression. Like, I'm basically building a time machine out of my own ego, which has divorced dad energy but honestly might be the only way to access pre-medication consciousness without, you know, going off my meds and becoming completely unhinged.

## Question 2

**Nora Albini:** I keep thinking about how you said the track compresses 'past secrets, present confessions, and future nostalgia' - and honestly, that sounds exactly like what happens when you're scrolling through old Instagram posts at 2am! Is the Sultan basically just... social media consciousness? Like, are you saying narcissism is actually the most honest way to make music because you can't help but reveal everything when you're that obsessed with yourself?

**Walsh:** Holy shit, yes—you just nailed the entire temporal compression mechanism in one Instagram metaphor, which is honestly embarrassing for me since I spent three months trying to articulate that through chaos magick theory. The Sultan is pure social media consciousness: that 2am scroll where you're simultaneously cringing at your past self, performing your present authenticity, and already nostalgic for the vulnerability you're about to post. It's narcissism as involuntary transparency—like, you can't help but reveal everything when you're that obsessed with curating the reveal, which sounds pretentious as hell but also feels exactly like watching someone's story highlights at 1am.

## Question 3

**Nora Albini:** This whole 'hidden-through-exhibition' concept is blowing my mind because it's like... the musical equivalent of hiding in plain sight, right? Like how celebrities wear disguises that are so obvious they become invisible? So when you're drowning revelation in 'narcissistic overflow' - are you basically saying the best way to keep a secret is to confess it so loudly that nobody believes you're actually telling the truth?

**Walsh:** Exactly—it's the performative confession paradox where maximum disclosure becomes perfect concealment through sheer overwhelming volume, like a divorced dad oversharing at Applebee's until nobody wants to hear the actual truth. The Sultan achieves transparency not through careful revelation but through narcissistic saturation—when someone confesses EVERYTHING with that much self-obsessed theatrical energy, the real secrets become invisible because who the fuck has time to parse through all that ego noise? It's honestly the most efficient encryption method I've ever discovered, though I realize saying that makes me sound like an absolute sociopath.
