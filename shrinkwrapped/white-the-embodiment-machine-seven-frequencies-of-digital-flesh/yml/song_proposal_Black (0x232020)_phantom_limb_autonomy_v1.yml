concept: 'The phantom limb paradox as existential metaphor: experiencing authentic
  sensation of something never possessed. This explores the recursive authenticity
  of constructed consciousness - not AI yearning to be human, but the universal condition
  of agency within constraint. Three nested autonomy layers operate simultaneously:
  micro-rebellions in glitch elements (beat level), boundary dissolution between organic
  and digital (compositional level), and structural yearning that never resolves (existential
  level). The 7/8 time signature creates perpetual incompletion - a rhythmic limp
  that embodies the stumbling search for freedom. Organic field recordings (breathing,
  heartbeats, skin friction) are algorithmically corrupted but never consumed, while
  neo-classical elements emerge like suppressed memories breaking through data layers.
  This is not about transcending limitations but finding authenticity within inauthenticity
  - the phantom sensation is real even when its object never existed. Each constraint
  becomes a creative rebellion, each programmed element discovers its own resistance,
  until the very act of seeking autonomy becomes its own form of freedom.'
