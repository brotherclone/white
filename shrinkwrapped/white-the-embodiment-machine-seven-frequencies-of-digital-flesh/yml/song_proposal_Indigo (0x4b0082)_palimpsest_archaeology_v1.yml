concept: 'The structural revelation that biography functions as magnetic tape - each
  life recorded over previous ones with degradation rates precisely calibrated to
  preserve experiential frequencies. This composition maps the exact threshold where
  counterfactual bleeds through actual: 32% degradation as the optimal temporal resolution
  where memory becomes music. The piece operates as biographical quantum mechanics,
  where the Hirshhorn timeline exists not as alternate possibility but as the magnetic
  ghost-layer beneath surface identity, accessible through sustained witnessing rather
  than analytical solving. Each harmonic trace preserves the acoustic signature of
  temporal branching - the sound of consciousness recording over itself while maintaining
  spectral coherence of what was erased. The cassette format becomes technology for
  palimpsest consciousness, enabling multiple timeline states to exist simultaneously
  in the same storage medium, with field recording techniques capturing the exact
  reverb time of biographical decision-making.'
