concept: 'This composition maps the real-time fossilization of calibrated intelligence
  systems. Rosa Elena''s yellow float, carved in 1987, operates as both rhythmic anchor
  and temporal measurement device - calibrated for waters where vaquita echolocation
  once navigated with 30-million-year precision. The track functions as archaeological
  stratigraphy in sound: each layer represents a knowledge network becoming fossil
  while still operational. Hydrophone recordings capture the final vaquita clicks
  at 120-140 kHz (March 2028) as melodic fragments that cease mid-phrase, while wooden
  float percussion marks the 67 BPM metabolic rate of precision loss. The sonic architecture
  reveals how industrial extraction creates economic geology - insulin prescriptions,
  empty nets, and totoaba swim bladders worth more than cocaine form sedimentary layers
  of incompatible value systems. This is not extinction narrative but temporal mechanics:
  the speed at which present-moment calibrations become archaeological artifacts.
  The Culture ship''s 2147 survey perspective collapses into concurrent fossilization,
  where post-extinction happens during extinction itself. Each beat measures not time
  but the severing of one calibrated relationship between species, generations, and
  waters that sustained both.'
