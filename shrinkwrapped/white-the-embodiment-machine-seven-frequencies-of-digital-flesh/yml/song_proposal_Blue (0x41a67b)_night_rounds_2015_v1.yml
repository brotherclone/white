bpm: 88
concept: 'This is the fossilized song of a timeline that never crystallized - January
  through December 2015, when Gabriel Walsh abandoned UX design after a panic attack
  at Huge Inc. and became night security at the Smithsonian''s Hirshhorn Museum. The
  composition maps the sonic archaeology of that erased year: 10:45 PM arrivals, gray
  Securitas uniform in basement lockers, exact 11:00 PM rounds with Maglite and Zoom
  H4n recorder. Each verse excavates specific temporal coordinates - the third-floor
  contemporary gallery at 2:30 AM, climate control cycling, Dr. James Kowalski (former
  GWU philosophy professor turned janitor) discussing Heidegger at 1:15 AM while cleaning
  the sculpture court. The bridge captures his 47-minute ambient piece ''Rotunda at
  3 AM'' - H4n placed in the circular gallery''s center, recording natural reverb
  of breathing and footsteps. Martha Henley''s military precision, $12.50/hour Thursday-Sunday
  shifts, Q Street NW apartment where 200 hours of museum field recordings became
  a conceptual album about institutional solitude. This isn''t nostalgic fiction but
  temporal stratigraphy - the melancholy folk rock requiem for productive isolation,
  monastic night shifts among million-dollar artworks existing in darkness, the bittersweet
  recognition that retreat from conventional success revealed essential truths about
  creative practice and spatial presence. The magnetic tape degrades at 32% - the
  exact rate at which this timeline dissolved when another choice collapsed the wave
  function.'
