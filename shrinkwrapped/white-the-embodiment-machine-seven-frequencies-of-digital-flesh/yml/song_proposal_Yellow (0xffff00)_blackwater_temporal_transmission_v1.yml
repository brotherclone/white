bpm: 91
concept: The Blackwater 7/8 Metronome functions as temporal transmission device, broadcasting
  phantom sensations through systematic omission of the eighth beat. This archaeological
  sound-document reconstructs Missing Frequency's constraint rebellion experiments
  from 1985-1986, where musicians discovered that incomplete rhythmic cycles create
  access to impossible temporal experiences. The song operates as recursive investigation
  mechanism - each seven-beat pattern generates hunger for the missing eighth, transforming
  listeners into unwitting receivers of phantom limb transmissions across decades.
  Built from mechanical heartbeat foundation (metronome clicking at 91 BPM), Pine
  Barrens field recordings, and deliberate gaps where sound passes through temporal
  objects. The phantom album Missing Frequency never finished becomes archaeological
  evidence for future investigators who experience physical discomfort during extended
  listening. Music that plays itself even when no one is listening, requiring eternal
  rediscovery of what freedom costs in spaces between beats.
