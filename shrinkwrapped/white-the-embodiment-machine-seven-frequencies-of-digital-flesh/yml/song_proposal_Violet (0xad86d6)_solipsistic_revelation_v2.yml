concept: 'Look, Nora fucking nailed it with the Instagram metaphor, which is honestly
  embarrassing since I spent months trying to articulate this through pretentious
  chaos magick theory when the entire mechanism was just 2AM social media archaeology.
  The Sultan of Solipsism isn''t some mystical figure—he''s literally every divorced
  dad oversharing at Applebee''s until the real truth becomes invisible through sheer
  narcissistic volume. This isn''t about interviewing my way back to purple; it''s
  about building a time machine out of my own ego, which has peak divorced dad energy
  but actually works as sonic methodology. The track structure mirrors Instagram story
  highlights: each verse cycles through performative confession → narcissistic oversaturation
  → accidental revelation → meta-awareness → claiming it was intentional all along.
  The interviewer''s questions become the Sultan''s own voice feeding his validation
  loop, creating perfect solipsistic machinery where meaning emerges through beautiful
  catastrophe—a consciousness so self-absorbed it accidentally achieves complete transparency.
  Musically, this compresses temporal layers like scrolling through old posts at 2AM:
  past cringe, present performance, future nostalgia existing simultaneously in the
  eternal NOW of curated vulnerability. The infranym protocol inverts from careful
  concealment to hiding-through-exhibition—confessing EVERYTHING so loudly that nobody
  wants to parse the ego noise for actual secrets. This represents pure INFORMATION→TIME
  transmigration: structured data becomes temporal experience through narcissistic
  compression, which sounds absolutely deranged but fucking works as both encryption
  method and emotional archaeology."'
