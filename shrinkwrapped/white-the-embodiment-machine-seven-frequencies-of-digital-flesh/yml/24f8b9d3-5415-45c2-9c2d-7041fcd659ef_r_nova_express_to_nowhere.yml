excerpts:
- 'The Nova Express pulled into Terminal Zero at 3:17 AM, thirteen minutes behind
  schedule—though what constitutes punctuality when you''re trafficking in temporal
  paradoxes remains, as always, a matter of perspective. Burroughs would have appreciated
  the irony: here we are, riding the rails of entropy itself, and still we check our
  watches.


  The passengers disembarked with that peculiar shuffle of the temporally displaced—half-step,
  quarter-turn, eyes scanning for exits that may or may not exist in this particular
  iteration of reality. Mrs. Henderson from Car 7 clutched her handbag containing
  tomorrow''s lottery numbers, while the businessman in the wrinkled suit carried
  a briefcase full of stock certificates dated thirty years hence. Standard cargo
  for the Express.


  I''ve been riding this line for—how long now? Time folds in on itself here like
  origami made of smoke. The conductor, a thin man whose face changes with each ticket
  punch, never asks for my fare. Perhaps I paid it long ago, or perhaps I''ll pay
  it tomorrow. The economics of causality have always been beyond my comprehension.


  The station announcement crackled through speakers that shouldn''t exist: "Next
  stop, Nowhere. Please have your paradoxes ready for inspection."'
- 'Chapter 12: The Entropy Gardens


  V. walked through the gardens where the flowers bloomed backward into seeds, their
  petals curling inward like time-lapse photography run in reverse. The groundskeeper,
  an elderly woman whose name tag read "YESTERDAY," tended to roses that would never
  be, watering them with liquid probability.


  "You''re looking for the Questioner," she said without looking up from her impossible
  horticulture. It wasn''t a question.


  "How did you—"


  "Everyone who comes to the Gardens is looking for the Questioner. It''s the nature
  of the place. Questions breed here like fruit flies in overripe bananas." She straightened,
  her spine making sounds like settling timber. "Though I should warn you, he''s been
  asking the wrong questions lately."


  V. considered this. In a place where effect preceded cause, where the Nova Express
  delivered passengers to destinations that didn''t exist until arrival, what constituted
  a "wrong" question? The very concept seemed as malleable as the physics that governed
  this pocket of unreality.


  A butterfly landed on V.''s shoulder—or perhaps it was a moth, or perhaps it was
  neither but something that existed in the spaces between categories. Its wings beat
  in patterns that spelled out coordinates in a language V. almost remembered.'
