bpm: 67
concept: 'Two knowledge systems die simultaneously across the same waters - vaquita
  echolocation frequencies optimized for thirty million years of Gulf navigation,
  and Rosa Elena''s inherited tide-reading wisdom passed down through four generations
  of fishermen. The song maps their parallel obsolescence: hydrophone recordings capture
  the final clicks at 120-140 kHz while Rosa''s father''s yellow float bobs in pawn
  shop fluorescence, both artifacts of co-evolved intelligence rendered fictional
  by industrial extraction. The 67 BPM heartbeat synchronizes with the vaquita''s
  resting pulse as gillnets designed for totoaba swim bladders worth more than cocaine
  accidentally harvest the last endemic consciousness from waters that no longer exist
  in any meaningful sense. Each missing beat represents knowledge that took millennia
  to develop and mere decades to extinguish - not through dramatic collapse but through
  the quiet violence of economic systems that mistake precision for expendability.
  The song plays itself through the archaeological weight of mundane objects: wooden
  floats as temporal anchors, insulin prescriptions as death certificates for traditional
  ways of being, empty nets as monuments to relationships that industrial capitalism
  has made impossible to maintain.'
