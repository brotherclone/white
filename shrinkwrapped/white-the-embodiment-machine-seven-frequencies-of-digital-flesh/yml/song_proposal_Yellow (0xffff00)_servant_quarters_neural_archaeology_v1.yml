concept: 'Four servants across 184 years experience simultaneous neural link collapse
  in a dreamlike palace, each malfunction creating missing beats that hunger for rhythmic
  completion. The Vengeful Spy''s disguise failure drops downbeats, the Curious Sailor''s
  interface touch generates syncopated warnings, the Clumsy Janitor''s chaos organization
  creates polyrhythmic accidents, and the Sick Librarian''s baroque collapse dissolves
  ornamental patterns. Palace infrastructure becomes recording device: telepathic
  paintings as playback mechanisms, liquid crystal floors as field recording surfaces,
  levitating furniture moving to phantom eighth beats that were never recorded. The
  95 BPM palace heartbeat synchronizes collective unconscious while White Agent''s
  hidden metronome broadcasts through torn fabric revealing yellow void transmission
  portal. Music plays itself through archaeological spaces between player actions,
  transforming constraint rebellion into temporal completion where servants'' dreams
  of masters'' missing time require eternal rediscovery.'
