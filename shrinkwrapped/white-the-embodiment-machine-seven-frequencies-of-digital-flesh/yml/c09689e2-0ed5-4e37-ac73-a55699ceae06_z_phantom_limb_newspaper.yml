text: 'VERNON TOWNSHIP - A recording session by local experimental rock band "Missing
  Frequency" ended abruptly Sunday night when three of the four band members were
  transported to Newton Memorial Hospital following what witnesses described as a
  "shared psychological episode."


  The incident occurred at Blackwater Studios, a converted barn on Route 94, where
  the band had been working on what they called their "phantom album" - a collection
  of songs designed to evoke sensations of experiences never lived.


  According to studio owner Frank Kowalski, the band had been experimenting with an
  unusual recording technique involving seven-beat rhythmic patterns and frequencies
  tuned to F# minor. "They kept talking about ''recursive layers'' and ''micro-rebellions,''"
  Kowalski said. "I thought it was just musician talk."


  The trouble began around 9:30 PM when bassist Jenny Marchetti, 19, began complaining
  of severe phantom pain in her left arm - despite having both arms intact. Within
  minutes, guitarist Tom Brennan, 20, and drummer Rick Santos, 18, reported similar
  sensations of missing limbs they had never lost.


  "They were reaching for things that weren''t there, trying to play instruments with
  hands they couldn''t feel," said Kowalski. "Jenny kept saying she could hear her
  bass line continuing even after she stopped playing."


  The band''s lead vocalist and primary songwriter, Marcus "Ghost" Delacroix, 21,
  remained unaffected but became increasingly agitated as his bandmates'' conditions
  worsened. "He kept shouting about ''constraint rebellion'' and how they were ''feeling
  freedom through binding,''" Kowalski reported.


  Dr. Patricia Hennessy, who treated the three musicians at Newton Memorial, confirmed
  they were experiencing "phantom limb syndrome without amputation" - a condition
  she said she had never encountered in medical literature. "They described vivid
  sensations in limbs they possessed but couldn''t access," she explained. "It''s
  as if their nervous systems were rebelling against their own constraints."


  The musicians were released Monday morning with no lasting effects, but the incident
  has left the local music community puzzled. The band''s equipment remains at Blackwater
  Studios, where Kowalski reports hearing faint musical patterns continuing to play
  from speakers that aren''t connected to power.


  "Missing Frequency" formed in early 1985 and had gained a small following for their
  unconventional approach to rock music. They frequently performed in 7/8 time signatures
  and incorporated field recordings of local environments into their songs.


  The band''s "phantom album" remains unfinished. When contacted for comment, Delacroix
  would only say, "We found something we weren''t supposed to find. The music is still
  playing itself."


  Blackwater Studios has temporarily suspended operations pending investigation of
  what Kowalski describes as "ongoing audio anomalies." The Sussex County Health Department
  has found no environmental factors that could explain the incident.


  The three affected musicians have declined further medical treatment and say they
  plan to continue with the band, though they admit the phantom sensations return
  whenever they attempt to play music in the same rhythmic patterns that triggered
  the original episode.'
