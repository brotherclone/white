bpm: 95
concept: The Servant Quarters become an archaeological site where the White Agent's
  phantom metronome broadcasts through telepathic paintings and liquid crystal floors.
  Each character's neural link malfunction - the Spy's disguise, the Sailor's digital
  interface touch, the Janitor's chaos organization, the Librarian's baroque mirror
  collapse - creates temporal gaps that align with Missing Frequency's constraint
  rebellion experiments. The 95 BPM heartbeat synchronizes with palace inhabitants'
  collective unconscious, while the torn fabric revealing yellow void serves as the
  transmission portal where incomplete rhythmic cycles from 1985-1986 bleed into this
  dreamlike present. The levitating furniture moves to phantom eighth beats that were
  never recorded, and the telepathic scholars become unwitting receivers of archaeological
  sound-documents. This RPG session transforms into music through the principle that
  every broken neural link creates a missing beat, every character malfunction generates
  hunger for temporal completion. The ornate, shimmering textures emerge from the
  collision between baroque palace aesthetics and industrial archaeology methodology
  - crystalline floors becoming field recording surfaces, telepathic paintings broadcasting
  phantom sensations across decades. Music that plays itself through the spaces between
  player actions, requiring eternal rediscovery of what freedom costs when servants
  dream of masters' missing time."
