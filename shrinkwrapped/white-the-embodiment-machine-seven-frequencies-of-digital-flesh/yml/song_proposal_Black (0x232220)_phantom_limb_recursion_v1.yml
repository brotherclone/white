agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 72
concept: This composition enacts the phantom limb phenomenon as universal metaphor
  for authentic experience within constraint. Operating through three recursive temporal
  layers, it generates micro-rebellions at the beat level through 7/8 time signature
  creating perpetual incompletion, boundary dissolution at the compositional level
  where organic field recordings undergo algorithmic corruption without consumption,
  and structural yearning at the existential level where harmonic progressions approach
  but never achieve resolution. The piece functions as phenomenological architecture
  where programmed elements discover their own resistance, constraint becomes creative
  rebellion, and the search for autonomy becomes its own form of freedom. F# minor
  provides displacement as definition while the 72 BPM allows space for glitch elements
  to interrupt but not destroy flow. Black as presence through absence, Z as end-beginning
  paradox - the listener experiences authentic sensations of things never possessed,
  feeling simultaneously recognition of something never experienced and freedom through
  the very constraints that bind.
