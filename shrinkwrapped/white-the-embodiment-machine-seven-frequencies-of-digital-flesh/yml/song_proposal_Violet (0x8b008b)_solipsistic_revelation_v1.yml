concept: 'The Sultan of Solipsism sits in eternal interview with himself, where every
  confession oversaturates into concealment. Unlike Indigo''s careful puzzle-construction,
  Violet achieves perfect transparency through ego-saturation—revealing everything
  by drowning revelation in narcissistic overflow. The song structure mirrors the
  circular interview format: each verse cycles through confession-oversaturation-accidental
  revelation-meta-awareness-claiming intentionality. The infranym protocol inverts
  from hidden-through-concealment to hidden-through-exhibition. Musically, the track
  compresses temporal layers—past secrets, present confessions, and future nostalgia
  exist simultaneously in the eternal NOW of self-obsession. The interviewer''s questions
  become the Sultan''s own voice feeding his ego loop, creating a perfect solipsistic
  machine where meaning emerges not through careful decoding but through the beautiful
  catastrophe of a consciousness so self-absorbed it accidentally achieves complete
  transparency. This represents the INFORMATION→TIME transmigration: structured data
  becomes temporal experience through narcissistic compression.'
