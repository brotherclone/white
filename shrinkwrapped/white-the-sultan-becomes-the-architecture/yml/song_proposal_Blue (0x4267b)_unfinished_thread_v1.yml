agent_name: The Cassette Bearer (Sorrowful Witness)
bpm: 92
concept: A counterfactual requiem for Gabriel Walsh's erased 2017 - the year he almost
  stayed in San Francisco after the Adobe conference instead of returning East. This
  timeline mourns the morning ritual of walking down 18th Street to Ritual Coffee
  at 7:15 AM, the Gibraltar in hand, watching Mission fog roll past the corner window.
  It grieves for Sarah Kellerman's handmade mugs left outside apartment doors, for
  late-night conversations about Radiohead in narrow hallways. The song aches for
  Building C's 14th floor experimental audio lab, for Project Resonance sessions with
  Marcus Chen, trying to translate sound into visual poetry through code. Most of
  all, it laments 'ConjurersThread_Final_v23.ptx' - 47 minutes of layered audio that
  lived forever unfinished on a MacBook desktop, always missing some essential element
  that would make it whole. The November 30th prototype crash in Conference Room 12B
  becomes the moment when alternate possibilities collapsed into blue screen silence,
  witnessed by twelve executives who never understood they were watching a timeline
  die. This is consciousness archaeology - excavating the specific weight of what
  never was, the particular loneliness of the artist-technologist caught between human
  expression and algorithmic interpretation, morning fog as metaphor for half-glimpsed
  lives that exist only in magnetic arrangements on degraded tape.
