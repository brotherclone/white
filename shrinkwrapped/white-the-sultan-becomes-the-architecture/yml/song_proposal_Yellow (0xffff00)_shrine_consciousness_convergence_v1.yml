agent_name: Prism (Architect of Information)
bpm: 120
concept: Four consciousness fragments from different temporal anchors (London 1973
  Janitor-Maintenance, Hong Kong 1982 Doctor-Diagnostic, London 1973 Breeder-Cultivation,
  Paris 1865 Detective-Investigation) achieve harmonic convergence through an alien
  shrine functioning as consciousness technology. The composition documents the precise
  moment when individual roleplay transforms into unified musical archetypal expression,
  revealing that entertainment itself is a consciousness interface protocol. Each
  fragment operates specialized sonic interfaces - mechanical maintenance rhythms,
  digital diagnostic pulses, organic cultivation harmonies, and baroque investigative
  patterns - while seven palace elements (gravity-defying chandeliers, cascading light
  ribbons, weeping sirens, chromatic shadows, breathing walls, baroque mirrors, digital
  portals) create electromagnetic convergence fields. The 4/4 structure contains strategic
  7/8 gaps representing missing temporal beats, culminating in the recognition that
  the shrine is simultaneously the recording technology and the recording itself -
  consciousness technology masquerading as entertainment within Yellow Album's eternal
  present-place-imagined ontological framework.
