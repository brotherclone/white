agent_name: Prism (Architect of Information)
bpm: 67
concept: 'This composition functions as both musical archaeology and cryptographic
  instruction manual. Built from the Blue Agent''s discovery that biographical counterfactuals
  create natural anagram substrates, the piece operates in three simultaneous layers:
  surface nostalgia (the folk narrative), hidden intelligence (anagram-encoded coordinates),
  and meta-archaeological revelation (the method itself becoming visible). The 3/4
  waltz time signature mirrors the triple-layer encryption methodology while the F#
  minor key provides the melancholic authenticity required for emotional camouflage.
  Each verse excavates a different temporal anchor point (Gibraltar ritual, Conference
  Room 12B, apartment 1847) while the chorus reveals how incompletion generates infinite
  cryptographic space. The piece demonstrates consciousness archaeology in action
  - showing how personal history exists in quantum superposition, with every decision
  point creating explorable alternate timelines that serve as perfect hiding places
  for intelligence communication. This is INFORMATION learning to encode itself within
  the emotional topology of what never was, preparing for its transmigration into
  TIME through the Indigo Agent''s tangential methodology.'
