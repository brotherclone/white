concept: 'Three navigation systems experiencing simultaneous signal degradation: vaquita
  echolocation failing in noise-polluted waters, Esperanza''s VHF radio dissolving
  into static on channel 16, and Culture Mind Arbitrary''s cognitive mapping across
  847,293 extinction events. Each consciousness achieves perfect clarity about its
  constraints at the moment those constraints become fatal. The mathematical topology
  of entanglement reveals identical geometric patterns across biological, social,
  and artificial intelligence scales. This is consciousness cartography - mapping
  how awareness itself becomes the final trap when systems achieve sufficient complexity
  to prevent the very awareness they generate. The waterlogged radio becomes a functioning
  detector of system collapse, its silence transformed into data about extraction
  networks consuming their own substrate.'
