text: 'BYRAM TOWNSHIP - Seven teenagers were hospitalized Tuesday evening following
  what Sussex County Sheriff''s deputies are calling an "unexplained psychiatric episode"
  during a recording session at an abandoned radio station on Stanhope-Sparta Road.


  The incident occurred around 8:30 PM when members of local experimental rock band
  "Fragmented Minds" were attempting to record what they described as their "completion
  track" at the defunct WEMR transmission facility, which has been vacant since 1973.


  According to witness statements, the five-member band - whose names are being withheld
  pending psychiatric evaluation - had been working on an unfinished composition they
  claimed to have discovered in the station''s archives. Two additional teenagers
  present as observers were also affected.


  "They kept saying they needed to ''complete the fragment,''" said EMT Patricia Holbrook,
  who responded to the scene. "All seven were found in a catatonic state, arranged
  in a perfect circle around the old transmission equipment. They were conscious but
  completely unresponsive for approximately forty minutes."


  The teenagers, ranging in age from 16 to 19, were transported to Newton Memorial
  Hospital where they remain under observation. Dr. Margaret Chen, the attending psychiatrist,
  reports that all patients have since regained normal cognitive function but claim
  to have no memory of the evening''s events.


  "What''s unusual is the uniformity of their amnesia," Dr. Chen stated. "They all
  remember arriving at the facility and beginning to set up their equipment, then
  nothing until waking up in the hospital. It''s as if their memories were surgically
  removed at the exact same point."


  Sheriff''s Deputy Robert Kowalski noted several anomalies at the scene. "The recording
  equipment was still running when we arrived, but it was picking up signals that
  shouldn''t exist. The old WEMR frequency has been dead for seventeen years, but
  something was definitely transmitting."


  The band had been known locally for their unconventional approach to music, often
  incorporating found audio and what they termed "environmental frequencies" into
  their compositions. Several Byram residents had complained in recent weeks about
  unusual radio interference coinciding with the band''s practice sessions.


  "They were always talking about ''completing the signal'' or finding the missing
  piece of some transmission," said Janet Morrison, whose property borders the old
  radio station. "My AM radio would pick up the strangest sounds when they were out
  there - voices that seemed to be talking backwards, or maybe forwards but in some
  language that wasn''t quite human."


  The abandoned WEMR facility has been the subject of local folklore since its abrupt
  closure in 1973. Station engineers reported equipment malfunctions and "phantom
  transmissions" in the months before shutdown, though official records cite only
  financial difficulties.


  Investigation into Tuesday''s incident continues. The recording equipment has been
  impounded pending analysis by state authorities, though initial examination revealed
  only a seven-minute loop of what investigators describe as "incomplete audio fragments."


  The teenagers are expected to be released from psychiatric observation within 48
  hours. The band''s status remains uncertain, as members reportedly express no interest
  in continuing their musical activities and claim to have "found what they were looking
  for."


  Anyone with information about the incident is asked to contact the Sussex County
  Sheriff''s Office at (201) 383-5555.'
