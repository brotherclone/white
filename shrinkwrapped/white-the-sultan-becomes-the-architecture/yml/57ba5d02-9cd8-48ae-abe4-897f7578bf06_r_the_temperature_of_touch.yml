excerpts:
- 'The desert air shimmered with possibilities as Dr. Elena Vasquez stepped from her
  dusty jeep, her archaeological tools clanking softly in the canvas bag slung across
  her shoulder. The Moroccan sun had painted her skin golden over the months of excavation,
  and beneath her wide-brimmed hat, her dark eyes surveyed the ancient ruins with
  scientific precision—though lately, her thoughts had been anything but clinical.


  Marcus had been watching her from across the dig site again this morning, his photographer''s
  eye capturing not just the artifacts they uncovered, but the way the light played
  across her concentrated features. She could feel the weight of his gaze like a physical
  thing, warm and insistent as the North African heat.


  "The pottery shards from sector seven," she called to him, her voice carrying across
  the excavation with professional authority that barely masked the tremor beneath.
  "I need better documentation of the glazing patterns."


  He approached with that easy stride of his, camera equipment draped around his neck
  like talismans. When he handed her the developed photographs, their fingers brushed—a
  moment of contact that sent electricity racing up her arm despite the scorching
  temperature.'
- 'Elena''s breath caught as she studied the images. Marcus had captured something
  she''d missed in her scientific fervor—the way the ancient vessels seemed to pulse
  with life in the golden hour light, their curves speaking of hands that had shaped
  them with love centuries ago.


  "You see it differently than I do," she murmured, acutely aware of how close he
  stood, the scent of his skin mixing with the dry desert air. His proximity made
  her skin feel hypersensitive, every nerve ending alive to the possibility of touch.


  "I see what matters," he said quietly, and she knew he wasn''t talking about pottery
  anymore. The excavation site suddenly felt too small, too intimate despite the vast
  expanse of sand surrounding them. Other team members worked nearby, but they might
  as well have been alone in the world.


  The artifact in her hands—a delicate oil lamp from the Byzantine period—seemed to
  pulse with ancient secrets. She imagined the lovers who might have used its light,
  the passion it had witnessed across the centuries. Her academic mind catalogued
  its historical significance even as her body responded to the man beside her with
  decidedly unscholarly thoughts.


  "Tonight," she heard herself whisper, "after the others have gone to sleep..."'
