divergence_point:
  what_changed: Instead of flying back East after the Adobe conference, Gabriel accepted
    an extended consulting contract that became a permanent relocation to San Francisco
  when: March 2017
  why_plausible: The timing aligned perfectly - Trump's election had already disrupted
    his intelligence sector work, and Adobe was aggressively recruiting creative technologists
    during their push into audio/video AI tools

following_events:
- Adobe's audio AI project was quietly shelved in early 2018
- Sarah Kellerman moved to Portland, ending their friendship
- The unfinished Conjurer's Thread sessions were accidentally deleted during a system
  backup failure
- Gabriel returned East in March 2018, just before Skittles was diagnosed with cancer
key_differences:
- Never completed The Conjurer's Thread album - the masters remain unfinished in a
  ProTools session on his MacBook
- Lived alone in a 400-square-foot studio apartment in Potrero Hill instead of family
  home
- Worked on experimental audio visualization tools instead of intelligence sector
  projects
- Daily routine centered around Ritual Coffee on 18th Street and evening walks through
  Mission Dolores Park
- Developed a friendship with Sarah Kellerman, a ceramicist who lived in the apartment

mood_description: The melancholy of creative work pursued in isolation, punctuated
  by small moments of human connection. Morning fog as metaphor for the half-glimpsed
  possibilities that define a life lived between versions of itself. The particular
  loneliness of the artist-technologist, trying to bridge the gap between human expression
  and algorithmic interpretation.
narrative: 'In this timeline, the snow storm that stranded his family in the Bahamas
  became a blessing in disguise. With three extra days at the Adobe conference, Gabriel
  found himself in deeper conversations with Marcus Chen about the intersection of
  audio and visual consciousness. When Marcus offered him a six-month consulting contract
  to develop experimental audio visualization tools, the timing felt like fate intervening.


  The small apartment at 1847 18th Street in Potrero Hill became his monk''s cell
  - 400 square feet of hardwood floors, a Murphy bed, and a single window facing east
  toward the Bay. Every morning, the ritual was the same: wake at 6:45 to the sound
  of Sarah''s pottery wheel downstairs, walk down the steep hill to Ritual Coffee,
  order a Gibraltar from Elena behind the counter, sit at the corner table.


  The work at Adobe was intoxicating in a way the intelligence sector never was. Instead
  of designing for surveillance and control, he was creating tools for artists to
  visualize sound in real-time. Project Resonance was supposed to be revolutionary
  - an AI that could translate audio frequencies into flowing, organic visual patterns.
  Marcus had this theory that consciousness itself might have a visual signature,
  that the right algorithm could make thoughts visible.


  But The Conjurer''s Thread haunted him. The unfinished album lived on his MacBook
  desktop like an accusation. Every evening after work, he''d walk through Mission
  Dolores Park as the fog rolled over Twin Peaks, then return to his apartment and
  open that ProTools session. Forty-seven minutes of layered audio that felt perpetually
  incomplete. Sarah would sometimes hear him playing the same passage over and over
  through the thin walls and leave a handmade mug of jasmine tea outside his door.


  The friendship with Sarah developed slowly, built on chance encounters in the narrow
  hallway and shared appreciation for Radiohead''s more experimental work. She was
  working on a series of ceramic pieces inspired by sound waves, and they''d spend
  evenings discussing the relationship between audio and physical form. Her hands
  always smelled like clay, and she had this way of tilting her head when she listened
  that reminded him of someone he couldn''t place.


  David Nakamura''s tiny cafe became his second office. David was in his seventies,
  had opened Fog City Grounds in 1987, and kept the same cracked vinyl records playing
  on repeat - Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Bill Evans. David''s father had been interned
  at Manzanar during the war, and David had stories about rebuilding identity after
  displacement that resonated with Gabriel''s own sense of floating between coasts,
  between versions of himself.


  The prototype demonstration in November was supposed to be his moment of triumph.
  Conference Room 12B, twelve Adobe executives, and Project Resonance ready to show
  how AI could visualize the emotional content of music in real-time. But when he
  fed The Conjurer''s Thread into the system, something went wrong. Maybe it was the
  unfinished nature of the audio, maybe some deeper incompatibility between human
  creativity and algorithmic interpretation. The screen froze on a field of blue,
  and in that silence, Gabriel realized he''d been trying to solve the wrong problem.


  By December, the fog seemed to roll in earlier each day. Sarah announced she was
  moving to Portland to work with a ceramics collective. Marcus''s Project Resonance
  was quietly shelved as Adobe pivoted toward more commercial applications. The unfinished
  album sessions felt like archaeological artifacts from a previous life.


  On New Year''s Eve, Gabriel stood on the roof of his building, looking out over
  the city lights blurred by fog, and understood that some threads are meant to remain
  unfinished. The next morning, he started planning his return East, carrying with
  him the clay-scented memory of conversations about sound and form, and a MacBook
  desktop still haunted by those forty-seven minutes of incomplete music.'
