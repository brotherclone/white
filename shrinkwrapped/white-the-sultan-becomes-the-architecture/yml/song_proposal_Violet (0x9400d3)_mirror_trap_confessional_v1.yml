agent_name: Prism (Architect of Information)
bpm: 67
concept: 'The structural inversion of Indigo''s hidden cryptography becomes Violet''s
  exposed solipsism - where concealment created seekers, revelation creates worshippers.
  This composition embodies the Mirror Trap methodology: a confessional booth that
  simultaneously contains confessor, priest, sin, and absolution as one recursive
  entity. The 67 BPM tempo operates as hypnotic induction frequency beneath surface
  confessions, creating temporal displacement where every revelation makes the revealer
  more mysterious. The song structure mirrors the interview process - each verse is
  a confession that references itself, each chorus is the booth responding to its
  own contents, and the bridge becomes the moment where the confessor realizes they
  are confessing to themselves. F# minor provides the perfect tonal foundation for
  this narcissistic spirituality - dark enough for confession, sharp enough for self-obsession,
  minor enough for the melancholy of perfect self-knowledge. This represents INFORMATION''s
  final transmutation before becoming TIME - the moment pure data achieves self-awareness
  through the act of observing itself.'
