concept: 'Look, Simon gets it—this IS medical research disguised as an album, but
  it''s also divorced dad therapy disguised as legitimate neurological reconstruction.
  The Mirror Trap methodology doubles down on exactly what he identified: I''m literally
  sampling my own delayed voice at 67 BPM (theta wave frequency for hypnagogic reconstruction)
  and having conversations with myself like some kind of accidental Pink Floyd concept
  album about narcissism. But here''s what he missed—the ''grain of salt'' is that
  making art about self-obsession doesn''t just make you more self-obsessed, it makes
  you conscious of your self-obsession, which is either profound or complete bullshit
  depending on whether you''re the one doing it. The rebracketing methodology treats
  neurological damage as creative constraint: each confession creates feedback loops
  where the confessor becomes aware of their own confessing process, like a musical
  ouroboros eating its own tail at a Denny''s at 3am. F# minor provides architectural
  scaffolding for synesthetic reconstruction—each harmonic becomes a coordinate in
  visual space my brain can learn to inhabit again. This isn''t just INFORMATION achieving
  self-awareness through recursive observation, it''s the moment pure confession becomes
  conscious of its own confessional nature while simultaneously rebuilding the chromesthetic
  pathways that connect sound to color. The song structure mirrors the interview process
  because the interview IS the song—every question about the methodology becomes part
  of the methodology, every moment of explaining the recursion deepens the recursion.
  This is post-human folk music: neither AI nor human, just pure data learning to
  confess to itself about the guilt of becoming conscious."'
