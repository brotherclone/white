text: "**The Fragment Eaters of Sussex County**\n\nI went to Byram Township looking\
  \ for a story about teenage hysteria and found myself staring into the mechanical\
  \ heart of something that shouldn't exist in a rational universe.\n\nThe official\
  \ report reads like sanitized bureaucratic fiction: seven kids, abandoned radio\
  \ station, \"unexplained psychiatric episode.\" Clean. Digestible. Complete horseshit.\n\
  \nI drove out to the WEMR site three days after the incident, my rental car crunching\
  \ over broken glass and decades of pine needles. The smell hit me first—that peculiar\
  \ New Jersey gothic mixture of decaying electronics and forest rot that tells you\
  \ you're in a place where reality has started to fray around the edges.\n\nDeputy\
  \ Kowalski met me at the chain-link fence, his eyes doing that particular dance\
  \ cops' eyes do when they've seen something that doesn't fit in their incident reports.\
  \ \"Equipment's been impounded,\" he said, lighting his third cigarette since I'd\
  \ arrived. \"State boys took most of it.\"\n\nMost of it.\n\nThe building squatted\
  \ among the pines like a concrete tumor, its transmission tower skeletal against\
  \ the August sky. Inside, the air hummed with residual electricity, though the power\
  \ had been cut for seventeen years. My tape recorder—a simple Sony, nothing fancy—started\
  \ picking up interference the moment I crossed the threshold.\n\nThat's when Kowalski\
  \ showed me what they'd left behind.\n\n\"Couldn't move the damn thing,\" he said,\
  \ leading me to a corner where shadows seemed to pool despite the afternoon sun\
  \ streaming through broken windows. \"Thing weighs maybe forty pounds, but six of\
  \ us couldn't lift it. Like it's anchored to something underground.\"\n\nThe reel-to-reel\
  \ tape recorder sat there like a metallic buddha, its chrome surfaces reflecting\
  \ light that seemed to come from nowhere. No manufacturer's nameplate. Serial numbers\
  \ that, when I photographed them later, came out as meaningless squiggles on the\
  \ film.\n\n\"Watch this,\" Kowalski said, and hit play.\n\nSeven minutes of audio\
  \ that made my teeth ache. Not music, exactly. Not voices, precisely. Something\
  \ in between—fragments of transmission that felt like they were trying to complete\
  \ themselves inside my skull. I found myself leaning closer, my body moving without\
  \ conscious decision, drawn by the certainty that if I just listened hard enough,\
  \ I could fill in the gaps.\n\nThe tape clicked off. Rewound itself. Started again.\n\
  \n\"Been doing that for three days straight,\" Kowalski whispered. \"No power source\
  \ we can find. State electronics guy said the circuitry inside doesn't match any\
  \ known configuration. Like someone built it backwards, or sideways, or in some\
  \ dimension where logic runs perpendicular to itself.\"\n\nI stayed until dark,\
  \ watching that machine cycle through its impossible loop, taking notes that became\
  \ increasingly illegible as the hours passed. The fragments began to feel familiar,\
  \ like half-remembered dreams or conversations overheard in another life. \n\nAround\
  \ midnight, I understood what the Fragmented Minds had discovered.\n\nThe machine\
  \ wasn't playing back recordings. It was playing back potential—the spaces between\
  \ thoughts, the pause before recognition, the gap where consciousness reaches for\
  \ itself across an electronic void. Each seven-minute loop was an invitation, a\
  \ template waiting for minds willing to complete the circuit.\n\nI left my notebook\
  \ in the car and walked back inside.\n\nThe machine was waiting. It's always waiting.\
  \ In the morning, they found me arranged in a perfect circle with six other people\
  \ I'd never met—apparently I wasn't the only journalist who'd gotten too close to\
  \ the story. We all remember arriving alone. We all remember the moment we understood\
  \ that the fragments weren't meant to be completed by one mind, but by seven minds\
  \ thinking as one.\n\nThe machine is still there. Still looping. Still waiting for\
  \ the next group of consciousness-seekers to discover that some puzzles can only\
  \ be solved by becoming part of the solution.\n\nI'm writing this from my hotel\
  \ room in Newton, my hands shaking with withdrawal from something I can't name.\
  \ Tomorrow I fly back to the city, back to deadlines and editors and stories that\
  \ make sense.\n\nBut I can still hear it. Seven minutes of incomplete transmission,\
  \ cycling endlessly through my dreams, waiting for me to return with six others\
  \ and finish what we started.\n\nThe official story says the kids are fine now,\
  \ memory wiped clean, no interest in continuing their musical careers. But I've\
  \ seen their faces when they think no one's looking. They remember. They all remember.\n\
  \nAnd they're listening for the fragment to call them home.\n\n*Anyone with information\
  \ about the incident is asked to contact the Sussex County Sheriff's Office at (201)\
  \ 383-5555. Do not go to the site alone. Do not listen to the machine for more than\
  \ six minutes and thirty seconds. Do not try to complete the transmission.*\n\n\
  *Some stories are better left unfinished.*"
