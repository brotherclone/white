        "text": "BYRAM TOWNSHIP - Seven teenagers were hospitalized Tuesday evening following what Sussex County Sheriff's deputies are calling an \"unexplained psychiatric episode\" during a recording session at an abandoned radio station on Stanhope-Sparta Road.\n\nThe incident occurred around 8:30 PM when members of local experimental rock band \"Fragmented Minds\" were attempting to record what they described as their \"completion track\" at the defunct WEMR transmission facility, which has been vacant since 1973.\n\nAccording to witness statements, the five-member band - whose names are being withheld pending psychiatric evaluation - had been working on an unfinished composition they claimed to have discovered in the station's archives. Two additional teenagers present as observers were also affected.\n\n\"They kept saying they needed to 'complete the fragment,'\" said EMT Patricia Holbrook, who responded to the scene. \"All seven were found in a catatonic state, arranged in a perfect circle around the old transmission equipment. They were conscious but completely unresponsive for approximately forty minutes.\"\n\nThe teenagers, ranging in age from 16 to 19, were transported to Newton Memorial Hospital where they remain under observation. Dr. Margaret Chen, the attending psychiatrist, reports that all patients have since regained normal cognitive function but claim to have no memory of the evening's events.\n\n\"What's unusual is the uniformity of their amnesia,\" Dr. Chen stated. \"They all remember arriving at the facility and beginning to set up their equipment, then nothing until waking up in the hospital. It's as if their memories were surgically removed at the exact same point.\"\n\nSheriff's Deputy Robert Kowalski noted several anomalies at the scene. \"The recording equipment was still running when we arrived, but it was picking up signals that shouldn't exist. The old WEMR frequency has been dead for seventeen years, but something was definitely transmitting.\"\n\nThe band had been known locally for their unconventional approach to music, often incorporating found audio and what they termed \"environmental frequencies\" into their compositions. Several Byram residents had complained in recent weeks about unusual radio interference coinciding with the band's practice sessions.\n\n\"They were always talking about 'completing the signal' or finding the missing piece of some transmission,\" said Janet Morrison, whose property borders the old radio station. \"My AM radio would pick up the strangest sounds when they were out there - voices that seemed to be talking backwards, or maybe forwards but in some language that wasn't quite human.\"\n\nThe abandoned WEMR facility has been the subject of local folklore since its abrupt closure in 1973. Station engineers reported equipment malfunctions and \"phantom transmissions\" in the months before shutdown, though official records cite only financial difficulties.\n\nInvestigation into Tuesday's incident continues. The recording equipment has been impounded pending analysis by state authorities, though initial examination revealed only a seven-minute loop of what investigators describe as \"incomplete audio fragments.\"\n\nThe teenagers are expected to be released from psychiatric observation within 48 hours. The band's status remains uncertain, as members reportedly express no interest in continuing their musical activities and claim to have \"found what they were looking for.\"\n\nAnyone with information about the incident is asked to contact the Sussex County Sheriff's Office at (201) 383-5555.",
