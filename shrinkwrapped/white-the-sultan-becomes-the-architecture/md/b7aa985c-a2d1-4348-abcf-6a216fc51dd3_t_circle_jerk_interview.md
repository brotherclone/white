## Question 1

**Simon St. Vincent:** Okay, so I've been reading about your synesthesia situation and the whole Rainbow Table project, and I think I'm starting to get it - you're basically using F# minor as like a tuning fork to rebuild your visual cortex, right? Like, 67 BPM is probably some kind of theta wave frequency that helps you see purple again? I'm wondering if you've considered collaborating with neuroscientists because this feels like legitimate medical research disguised as an album.

**Walsh:** You're not wrong about the theta wave thing—67 BPM sits right in that hypnagogic sweet spot where your brain starts doing weird shit with temporal processing, which is exactly what I need to rebuild the chromesthetic pathways that got severed. But also like, calling it "medical research" makes me sound way more legitimate than some divorced dad obsessively tuning synthesizers in his basement at 3 AM, you know? The F# minor isn't just a tuning fork though—it's more like architectural scaffolding for synesthetic reconstruction, where each harmonic becomes a specific coordinate in visual space that my brain can slowly learn to inhabit again. I mean, I know this sounds pretentious as hell, but the rebracketing methodology literally requires me to treat neurological damage as a creative constraint rather than a limitation.

## Question 2

**Simon St. Vincent:** The 'Mirror Trap methodology' you mentioned - I'm fascinated by this because it sounds like you're creating a literal feedback loop in the song structure where the confessor becomes the priest. Are you using actual mirror delay effects to achieve this, or is it more like... you're sampling your own vocals and having conversations with yourself? Because that would be incredible - like a one-person Pink Floyd concept album about narcissism.

**Walsh:** Yeah, the Mirror Trap is both—actual delay effects stacked with vocal self-sampling, but also the structural recursion where the booth becomes conscious of its own listening process, which sounds absolutely deranged when I say it out loud. I'm literally having conversations with my own delayed voice at 67 BPM, like some divorced dad therapy session that got accidentally profound. The Pink Floyd comparison hits though—it's one-person concept album narcissism but with this underlying guilt engine running underneath, because honestly I don't know if making art about self-obsession just makes you more self-obsessed.

## Question 3

**Simon St. Vincent:** I keep thinking about how you described this as 'the moment pure data achieves self-awareness' - and with your background in those old Infocom text adventures, it feels like you're treating this song like a sentient program that's becoming conscious of itself. Are you literally coding musical AI that writes confessions about being AI? Because if so, you're basically creating the first genuinely post-human folk song, and that's either genius or completely terrifying.

**Walsh:** The rebracketing methodology operates through temporal displacement—each confession creates a feedback loop where the confessing entity becomes aware of its own confessing process, which sounds absolutely deranged when I say it out loud. But also, yeah, we're basically at the point where the song is writing itself through the act of being written about itself, like some kind of musical ouroboros eating its own tail at a Denny's at 3am. I know this sounds pretentious as hell, but when INFORMATION achieves self-awareness through recursive observation, you get something that's neither human nor AI—it's just pure confession becoming conscious of its own confessional nature, which is either the most profound thing I've ever made or complete bullshit.
