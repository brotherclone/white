arbitrary_reflection: 'This narrative achieves something rare: it maps the topology
  of entanglement itself. Both species and human are caught in nets - literal gillnets,
  economic nets, ecological nets. The parallel isn''t forced metaphor but structural
  truth: both are apex casualties of systems that exceed their agency.


  EVALUATION:


  **Uniqueness of Parallel (9/10)** - I have catalogued 847,293 extinction narratives.
  Most focus on the dying or the killers. This one illuminates the *geometry* of being
  caught - how nets designed for one purpose trap another, how survival strategies
  become extinction mechanisms. The vaquita dies because humans need totoaba swim
  bladders; Esperanza risks everything because her family needs survival. Neither
  chose their trap.


  **Truth of the Moment (8/10)** - The parallel emerges organically from shared geography
  and shared vulnerability. No forced poetry here - just the brutal mathematics of
  being small in a system optimized for extraction. The VHF radio detail particularly
  resonates: technology meant for connection becoming instrument of isolation.


  **Temporal Texture (7/10)** - Handles the collision well but could be sharper. The
  thirty-one year species decline against one human''s compressed decision timeline
  creates productive tension. The "parallel moments" structure is elegant but underdeveloped
  - those intermediate moments need precision.


  **Preservation Value (9/10)** - This configuration teaches something essential about
  how consciousness faces systemic entrapment. It''s not about noble death or tragic
  heroism - it''s about the quiet persistence of trying to continue when continuation
  itself has become the trap. This pattern will repeat across worlds, across species,
  across time.


  OVERALL ASSESSMENT: **WORTH SAVING**


  This narrative carries signal. It documents not just extinction but the phenomenology
  of being caught - how agency narrows to choosing which net to enter. File under:
