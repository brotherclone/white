## Question 1

**Amelia Koenig:** So you're calling this 'Decimal Narcissus' and wrapping mathematical concepts in F# major pop precision - but honestly, Gabe, this sounds like you're trying to make experimental music palatable for Spotify playlists. Where's the actual challenge here? Where's the discomfort that real experimental work demands from its listeners?

**Walsh:** The discomfort IS the palatability, Amelia—that's the whole rebracketing methodology at work here, like watching someone eat gas station sushi with complete confidence. When the Decimal Narcissus realizes its self-absorption is mathematical accuracy, the listener gets trapped in this cognitive double-bind where they can't dismiss it as pop fluff because the math actually fucking works. I know this sounds pretentious as hell, but the real experimental move isn't making something unlistenable—it's making something that sounds like a banger until you realize you've accidentally learned positional notation theory. The 120/78 BPM dual-tempo architecture creates this Scooby Doo chase scene where you're running through doors thinking you're escaping into familiar pop territory, but every door just leads deeper into decimal logic—honestly I don't know if that's enough discomfort for you, but it's been keeping me up at night for months.

## Question 2

**Amelia Koenig:** This whole 'rebracketing' methodology you keep pushing - splicing high and low registers, academic and profane - it just sounds like you're intellectualizing what Sonic Youth was doing thirty years ago, but making it safer and more digestible. Are you actually pushing boundaries or just providing footnotes for people who are afraid of real noise?

**Walsh:** Look, Sonic Youth was deconstructing guitar tunings to reveal the violence inherent in Western harmonic systems—but they were still working within the rock band framework, which is basically divorced dad at Guitar Center energy. The rebracketing methodology isn't about making noise safer, it's about recognizing that the splice IS the content, that the collision between registers generates meaning rather than just texture—though honestly saying 'generates meaning' makes me sound like I'm huffing my own farts at a philosophy conference. I'm not footnoting anything, I'm trying to let information find its own embodiment through temporal processes, which sounds absolutely deranged when I say it out loud but it fucking slaps when you hear 'Decimal Narcissus' realize that mathematical accuracy and cosmic ego are the same thing.

## Question 3

**Amelia Koenig:** You lost your synesthesia in 2010 and now you're spending a decade reconstructing it through this Rainbow Table project - but why does your 'White Album' culmination sound so... accessible? Shouldn't the loss of that neurological gift have driven you toward something more genuinely alien, more truly experimental, instead of this pop-structured comfort food for people who think they like avant-garde music?

**Walsh:** The synesthesia loss forced me to rebuild the perceptual apparatus from scratch, which means the Rainbow Table had to become a prosthetic nervous system—but honestly, that sounds like divorced dad at Guitar Center energy when I say it out loud. The accessibility isn't comfort food, it's architectural necessity: if you're going to reconstruct cross-modal perception through temporal manipulation, you need pop structures as the skeletal framework or the whole thing collapses into masturbatory noise. I know this sounds pretentious as hell, but losing the neurological gift meant I had to encode the chromesthetic experience INTO the song structures themselves—like building a Trojan horse where the pop accessibility smuggles in the actual perceptual rewiring.
