# Polar bear / Aput Kanguq

## Species Arc: Polar bear
Ursus maritimus: circumpolar apex predator, 25,000 individuals (2001). Sea ice habitat loss: 13% per decade. Hunting platform dependency: absolute. Population trajectory: stable to vulnerable to endangered to critically endangered to extinct in wild (2100). Cascade effects: ringed seal behavioral changes, Arctic marine ecosystem destabilization, trophic collapse.

## Human Arc: Aput Kanguq
Aput Kanguq: five generations of ice knowledge compressed into GPS coordinates on a government computer. Traditional hunting guide becomes extinction monitor. Ivory chisel becomes museum piece. Son chooses engineering over hunting. The ice reader reads empty water.

## Parallel Moments

### 1. Seventy years before extinction
**Species:** Polar bear populations stable at 25,000 individuals across nineteen subpopulations, sea ice extent normal

**Human:** Aput's grandfather teaches him to read ice thickness with the ivory chisel, how ice sings when it's safe to walk

*Connection: Both species and culture depend on predictable ice formation patterns established over millennia*

### 2. Thirty-three years before extinction
**Species:** Hudson Bay subpopulation shows first significant decline, bears coming ashore earlier each summer as ice breaks up

**Human:** Aput notices the ice roads to traditional hunting grounds forming two weeks later than his father's generation remembered

*Connection: Timing disruption begins - both bears and hunters must adapt to shifting seasonal patterns*

### 3. Twenty-five years before extinction
**Species:** Pregnant females struggle to find stable denning sites as permafrost melts and coastal erosion accelerates

**Human:** Aput takes his first government job monitoring bear populations because traditional guiding work becomes too unreliable

*Connection: Traditional reproduction and livelihood patterns become impossible to maintain*

### 4. Fifteen years before extinction
**Species:** Satellite tracking shows bears swimming record distances - up to 400 miles seeking ice platforms that no longer exist

**Human:** Aput travels 200 miles by snowmobile to find hunting grounds that used to be accessible by walking

*Connection: Both must journey impossible distances to reach what their ancestors found nearby*

### 5. Five years before extinction
**Species:** Last wild cubs recorded in Beaufort Sea subpopulation, mother and offspring swimming beyond satellite range

**Human:** Aput watches the final GPS signal disappear from his computer screen, closes the laptop, touches his grandfather's ivory chisel

*Connection: The moment of witnessing the end - technology records the absence of what once was abundant*

## Elegiac Quality
This achieves memorial without nihilism by honoring both the ecological precision of extinction data and the intimate knowledge of a culture that evolved alongside the disappearing species. The parallel structure creates dignity through witness rather than despair through explanation - both bear and human become part of the same quiet catastrophe, neither reduced to symbol nor sentiment, but preserved in the specificity of their loss.
