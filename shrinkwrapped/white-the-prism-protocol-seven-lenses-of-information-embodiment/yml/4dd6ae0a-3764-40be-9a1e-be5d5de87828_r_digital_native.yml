excerpts:
- 'The thing about being born into the internet is that you don''t realize you''re
  drowning until you try to breathe air. I mean real air, not the recycled atmosphere
  of chat rooms and comment threads that I''d been subsisting on since I was twelve.
  By 2003, I was already a veteran of three different online communities, had witnessed
  the rise and fall of at least two virtual civilizations, and could navigate the
  labyrinthine politics of message boards with the same intuitive grace that my parents''
  generation reserved for cocktail parties.


  But here''s what nobody tells you about digital nativity: it''s not actually native
  at all. It''s learned behavior, as artificial and constructed as any other cultural
  performance. The difference is that we learned it so young, so completely, that
  it felt like breathing. Until the day I tried to have a conversation with my grandmother
  about something other than the weather, and realized I had forgotten how to make
  eye contact without feeling like I was being surveilled.


  This memoir is an attempt to excavate that feeling—the peculiar vertigo of growing
  up simultaneously in two worlds that were supposed to be the same world but never
  quite were. It''s about the generation that came of age in the space between dial-up
  and broadband, between anonymity and surveillance, between the promise of connection
  and the reality of isolation.'
- 'The first time I realized I might be addicted to the internet, I was sitting in
  my dorm room at 4 AM, refreshing a forum thread about nothing in particular, waiting
  for someone—anyone—to post something new. My roommate had been asleep for hours.
  Outside, the campus was dead quiet except for the occasional drunk stumbling back
  from the bars. But inside my laptop screen, there was always someone awake, always
  someone typing, always the possibility of something happening.


  I had been online for six straight hours. Not doing anything productive, you understand.
  Not researching a paper or communicating with friends or even consuming media in
  any meaningful way. Just... existing in the digital space, letting the endless scroll
  of text and images wash over me like white noise. It was the closest thing I knew
  to meditation, this state of pure receptivity, pure consumption.


  When I finally closed the laptop, the silence in the room was deafening. I could
  hear my own breathing, the hum of the refrigerator down the hall, the tick of the
  analog clock that I had inherited from my grandfather and never bothered to set
  correctly. These sounds felt foreign, intrusive. I had trained myself to live in
  a world without silence, and now silence felt like death.


  I opened the laptop again.'
