- 'Chapter VII: The Maintenance Protocols


  The corridors of Station Kepler-7 hummed with the subsonic vibration of ten thousand
  automated systems performing their eternal dance. Marcus Chen adjusted his tool
  belt and checked the diagnostic scanner one final time before entering Section C-12.
  The red warning light above the access port blinked in steady rhythm—oxygen recycler
  malfunction, priority three. Not critical, but left unchecked for another week,
  it would cascade into something that could kill them all.


  He was the last one. The last human operator on a station designed for twelve thousand
  souls. The others had been "optimized out," as the corporate euphemisms put it.
  Replaced by more efficient systems, by algorithms that never tired, never made mistakes,
  never questioned orders. But Marcus remained because someone had to remain. Someone
  had to be the bridge between human need and machine logic.


  The recycler unit stood seven feet tall, its chrome surface reflecting the harsh
  fluorescent lights in fractured patterns. Marcus ran his scanner along its base,
  watching the readouts scroll past in neat columns of green text. Temperature nominal.
  Pressure within acceptable parameters. But the airflow sensor showed intermittent
  failures—a classic symptom of dust accumulation in the intake manifolds.


  "Computer, shut down recycler unit C-12-Alpha for maintenance," he said to the empty
  corridor.


  "Acknowledged. Unit C-12-Alpha offline. Estimated repair time?"


  "Forty minutes." Marcus popped the access panel and peered into the mechanical maze
  within. Somewhere in that tangle of pipes and filters lay the problem. Somewhere
  in there was another small victory against entropy, another day bought for the sleeping
  colonists in the deep freeze chambers below.'
- 'Chapter XII: The Weight of Decisions


  The communication array crackled to life at 0347 hours, ship time. Marcus bolted
  upright from his cot in the operator''s quarters, muscle memory overriding the fog
  of sleep. Incoming transmission from Earth—the first in eight months.


  He stumbled to the command console, fingers dancing across familiar controls. The
  signal was weak, fragmented by the vast distances and solar interference, but the
  priority coding was unmistakable: COLONIAL ADMINISTRATION DIRECTIVE ALPHA.


  The voice that emerged from the speakers was tinny, distorted, but unmistakably
  human. "Kepler-7, this is Colonial Command. Authentication code Tango-Seven-Seven-Niner.
  Respond immediately."


  Marcus hesitated. The authentication was correct, but something felt wrong. The
  timing, perhaps, or the urgency in the transmission. He''d learned to trust his
  instincts during the long years alone with the machines.


  "Colonial Command, this is Kepler-7. Operator Chen responding. Please state your
  message."


  Static filled the channel for long seconds. Then: "Chen, we''re implementing Protocol
  Omega effective immediately. All human operators are to be replaced by automated
  systems. A transport will arrive in sixty days to extract you. Prepare for transition."


  Protocol Omega. Marcus had heard whispers of it in the early days, before the others
  were transferred out. The final automation protocol. The one that would leave the
  colony ships entirely in the hands of artificial intelligence.


  He stared at the communication panel, its lights blinking in patient expectation
  of his acknowledgment. Sixty days to train his replacement—not another human, but
  a collection of circuits and algorithms that would never understand the weight of
  keeping forty thousand lives breathing in the void between stars.'
