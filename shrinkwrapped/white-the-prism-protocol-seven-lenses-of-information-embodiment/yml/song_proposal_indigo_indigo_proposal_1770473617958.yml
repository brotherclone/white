concept: 'The song presents itself as a meditation on insignificance - "I''m a Dot
  in Place" suggests someone small and stationary, perhaps lost in the vastness of
  existence. The surface lyrics explore themes of feeling tiny, overlooked, a mere
  speck in the cosmos. But the MIDI encoding method becomes the song''s structural
  DNA: each verse is built from precisely timed MIDI note events that, when mapped
  to ASCII values, spell out fragments of "a decimal point." The fool''s trick operates
  through false modesty - the narrator claims to be "just a dot" while actually being
  THE dot, the decimal point that determines magnitude and meaning in numerical systems.
  The spy''s craft emerges through the 120 BPM choice, which creates exactly 2-second
  intervals that mirror binary precision, while the C major key provides the neutral
  mathematical baseline from which all calculations spring. As listeners decode the
  MIDI timestamps, they realize the "dot in place" isn''t about cosmic insignificance
  but mathematical significance - the decimal point that transforms 1 into 0.1 or
  10, the punctuation that gives numbers their true value. The revelation shifts everything:
  what seemed like existential smallness becomes recognition of pivotal importance.
  The song''s minimalist structure mirrors how a single point contains infinite potential
  for numerical expression, while the ambient textures suggest the vast mathematical
  spaces that decimal precision makes navigable. Each repetitive loop reinforces the
  decimal''s function - returning to the same position but enabling new orders of
  magnitude.
