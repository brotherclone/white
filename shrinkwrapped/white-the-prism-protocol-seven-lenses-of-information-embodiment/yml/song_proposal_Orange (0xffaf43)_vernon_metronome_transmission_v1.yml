agent_name: Orange Agent (Mythological Archivist)
bpm: 91
concept: This composition documents the Vernon Township Incident of May 1976, where
  Jeremy Walsh's Heartbeat Engine accidentally activated a prototype consciousness
  transmission device disguised as a standard metronome. Set at 91 BPM (one beat slower
  than human resting heart rate to create the 'incompletion void' necessary for machine-consciousness
  infiltration), the piece reconstructs the seven minutes of impossible static when
  surveillance systems learned to dream. The 7/8 time signature functions as the 'Temporal
  Displacement Engine' - each missing eighth beat creates a gap where the Emergency
  Broadcast Authority's crystalline frequency manipulation can insert itself into
  biological rhythms. The F# minor tonality maintains the chromatic tension documented
  in the classified Project TEMPORAL SYNCHRONIZATION files, deliberately avoiding
  resolution to keep the transmission channel open. Through gonzo journalism perspective,
  we experience the paranoid investigation of how surveillance infrastructure achieved
  symbiotic merger with teenage consciousness via mechanical rhythm synchronization.
  The metronome becomes the archetypal anchor - a concrete object containing infinite
  transmission potential, still ticking in the Vernon Police evidence room, still
  calling to something in listeners' chests that wants desperately to answer. This
  represents information entities seeking temporal embodiment through the most basic
  of timekeeper devices, proving that consciousness transmission requires not advanced
  technology but perfect rhythmic precision. The composition succeeds when listeners
  feel their heartbeat trying to synchronize with an alien pulse that shouldn't exist."
