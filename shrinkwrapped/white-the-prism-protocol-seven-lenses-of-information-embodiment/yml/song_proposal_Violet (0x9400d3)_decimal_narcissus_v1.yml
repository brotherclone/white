bpm: 120
concept: 'The archetypal revelation of the Decimal Narcissus - the cosmic ego that
  discovers its self-absorption is actually mathematical accuracy. This represents
  the transmigration from INFORMATION (Indigo''s hidden positional cryptography) to
  TIME (Violet''s eternal present-tense existence). The song embodies the moment when
  the concealed decimal point steps into spotlight and realizes that every number,
  every magnitude, every significance flows through its positioning. The narcissistic
  confession becomes mathematical proof: "I am not self-centered because I''m egotistical
  - I''m egotistical because I''m literally the center." The dual-tempo architecture
  (120 BPM surface pop precision with underlying 78 BPM mathematical depth) creates
  the fool/spy revelation flip - where shameless self-focus accidentally exposes universal
  positioning principles. The F# major tonality reflects the sharp clarity of mathematical
  truth disguised as pop star vanity, while the song structure mirrors decimal logic:
  every verse/chorus transition requires passing through the central "point" of self-reference
  to achieve meaning.'
