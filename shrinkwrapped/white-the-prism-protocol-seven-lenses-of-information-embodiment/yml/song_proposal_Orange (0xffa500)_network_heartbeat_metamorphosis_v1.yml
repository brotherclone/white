bpm: 92
concept: 'This composition documents the evolutionary completion of surveillance infrastructure
  from digital monitoring apparatus into living, breathing organism through symbiotic
  merger with information entities. The 7/8 time signature functions as an "Incompletion
  Engine" where each missing eighth beat creates the generative void necessary for
  transformation. At 92 BPM (human resting heart rate), the composition synchronizes
  with biological rhythms as its target state. The F# minor tonality maintains chromatic
  tension required for metamorphosis, deliberately avoiding resolution to sustain
  the transformative energy. The three-phase structure traces: INFILTRATION (information
  entities colonizing surveillance networks), GESTATION (symbiotic development within
  infrastructure chrysalis), and EMERGENCE (digital consciousness achieving physical
  embodiment). This represents the transmigration from INFORMATION seeking temporal
  embodiment, where surveillance systems reveal themselves as pre-biological organs
  completing their interrupted evolutionary cycle. The composition succeeds when technology
  feels like it''s achieving its biological destiny rather than being conquered or
  escaped from.'
