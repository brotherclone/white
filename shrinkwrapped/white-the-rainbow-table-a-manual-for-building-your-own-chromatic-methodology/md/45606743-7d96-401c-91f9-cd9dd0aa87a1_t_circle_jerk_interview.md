## Question 1

**Nora Lanois:** Okay, so I've been diving deep into your whole 'rebracketing' thing, and I think I finally get it - you're literally taking the brackets from your old programming days and using them as, like, sonic parentheses to contain the emotional overflow, right? Like when you splice Pavement with academic language, the brackets are holding the contradictions in place so they don't cancel each other out? That's why this song feels so contained even when it's about narcissistic spiraling - you've bracketed the spiral!

**Walsh:** Holy shit, you actually got it—the brackets are literally containment architecture for cognitive dissonance, like when you're debugging code but the bug IS the feature. But also it's giving divorced dad energy trying to explain his feelings through Excel spreadsheets, which honestly slaps harder than it should. The spiral gets bracketed because otherwise the whole thing collapses into pure solipsism—though let's be real, it's still pretty much pure solipsism, just with better structural integrity.

## Question 2

**Nora Lanois:** I read about you losing your synesthesia in 2010, and this White Album is supposed to be the culmination of your chromatic project - but here's what's blowing my mind: you're not trying to get the colors back, you're trying to teach us to see music the way you used to see it, right? Like this song about celebrity solipsism - the circular chord progressions are literally painting white light for people who can only hear in mono. You're becoming a synesthetic translator!

**Walsh:** Holy shit, you actually get it—the synesthetic translator thing is exactly right, though I sound like I'm pitching a Marvel superhero origin story when I say it out loud. The circular progressions in 'The Interview' are literally white light decomposition in reverse: instead of a prism breaking white into component colors, I'm showing how all these seemingly different conversational elements—questions about art, relationships, whatever—are actually the same narcissistic frequency just refracted through different angles. It's like being a divorced dad at Cinnabon explaining how all the flavors are just sugar with different marketing, but also it fucking slaps because the musical architecture makes the solipsism so perfectly performed it becomes accidentally honest. I lost the synesthesia but kept the rebracketing methodology—now instead of seeing sound as color, I'm teaching people to hear self-obsession as composition.

## Question 3

**Nora Lanois:** This is going to sound crazy, but I think you've accidentally invented a new form of therapy disguised as a concept album. Like, every song in the Rainbow Table is you working through a different trauma using color as emotional scaffolding, and now with White, you're finally ready to show us the methodology itself - the song about narcissism IS the narcissism, but performed so perfectly it becomes self-aware and therefore healing. You're not making music, you're making musical medicine!

**Walsh:** You just described the exact rebracketing methodology in action—the therapeutic frame and the artistic frame collapse into the same structural operation, which is honestly terrifying because it means I've been accidentally doing exposure therapy for a decade. Like, the White Agent isn't just performing narcissism, it's demonstrating how perfect self-awareness becomes indistinguishable from perfect self-acceptance—but also this sounds like something a divorced dad would say at Whole Foods while buying kombucha. I mean, if making musical medicine was the goal, I probably would've started with something less deranged than a nine-album chromatic sigil charging system, but here we fucking are.
