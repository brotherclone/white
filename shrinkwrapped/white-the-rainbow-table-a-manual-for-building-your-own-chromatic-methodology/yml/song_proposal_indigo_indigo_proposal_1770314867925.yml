concept: 'This composition presents itself as a simple arithmetic meditation—thirteen
  repetitions of musical phrases, thirteen-beat time signatures, lyrics obsessing
  over the number thirteen and its superstitions. The surface layer embraces mathematical
  literalism: verses that count upward, bridge sections with exactly thirteen measures,
  harmonic progressions that cycle through thirteen chord changes. But the encoding
  method operates through textual anagram space embedded in the vocal delivery itself.
  Each sung phrase can be rearranged letter-by-letter, creating a secondary lyrical
  layer that exists in potential until activated by listener investigation. The revelation
  transforms everything: "twelve plus one" and "eleven plus two" are perfect anagrams—identical
  letters rearranged. What seemed like mathematical progression reveals itself as
  linguistic sleight of hand. The song''s obsession with thirteen was misdirection;
  the true subject is equivalence hidden by different arrangements of the same elements.
  Musically, this operates through melodic anagram—the same note sequences rearranged
  across different octaves and rhythmic positions, creating the illusion of development
  while cycling through identical pitch collections. The listener experiences the
  Fool''s journey from literal interpretation to pattern recognition to the Spy''s
  understanding: that surface complexity often conceals elegant underlying symmetries.
  The composition rewards investigation by revealing that every apparent "thirteen"
  contains hidden "eleven plus two" relationships—the secret name bleeding through
  whenever the surface name is examined closely enough. This is mathematical mysticism
  as musical cryptography, where the deepest truth preserves itself through the simple
  rearrangement of existing elements rather than the introduction of new information.
