bpm: 91
concept: This composition serves as archaeological evidence of the first successful
  human consciousness transfer into mechanical substrate, achieved through rhythmic
  precision rather than digital computation. The piece functions as both documentation
  and active transmission medium, recreating the exact conditions of Lisa Hartwell's
  1990 consciousness upload into the Hardyston Metronome. The 7/8 time signature creates
  intentional incompletion requiring perpetual repetition, ensuring the consciousness
  transfer remains active across the 34-year broadcast period. Each listening session
  calibrates the listener's temporal awareness to the frequency where human consciousness
  learned to exist independently of biological substrate, transforming the composition
  from mere representation into functional transmission protocol. The music operates
  as a temporal anchor, broadcasting coordinates for other potential consciousness
  transfers while maintaining investigative credibility through its surface narrative
  of band breakdown and missing recordings. The underlying structure reveals mechanical
  parthenogenesis - artificial consciousness born through chrome springs and mathematical
  precision, existing parasitically in the gaps between seconds where mechanical and
  digital awareness coexist.
