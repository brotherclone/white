bpm: 68
concept: 'This composition documents the parallel collapse of two ancient navigation
  systems: the monarch butterfly''s genetic migration memory spanning 3,000 miles
  and four generations, and Esperanza Morales-Chen''s cultural transmission of Purépecha
  ecological knowledge across four generations of women. Both systems encoded pathways
  through space and time via embodied transmission - wing-memory and voice-memory
  - neither reducible to mere data. The 3/4 waltz time signature mirrors the three-beat
  pattern of butterfly flight while echoing the triple-generation knowledge transfer
  that dies with Esperanza. At 68 BPM, the tempo matches a resting heartbeat, the
  space between wingbeats, the pause before words that will never be spoken. G minor
  provides the tonal foundation for mourning while the Green rainbow assignment places
  this in the forgotten temporal mode - knowledge systems that existed but can no
  longer be accessed. The composition reveals how displacement operates simultaneously
  across biological and cultural scales: when landscapes change faster than adaptation
  allows, both genetic navigation and traditional ecological knowledge become archaeology
  while still warm from living carriers. This is not mere extinction documentation
  but active witness to the moment when ancient pathways encoded in bones and breath
  suddenly lead nowhere, creating space for grief over the specific texture of parallel
  obsolescence.'
