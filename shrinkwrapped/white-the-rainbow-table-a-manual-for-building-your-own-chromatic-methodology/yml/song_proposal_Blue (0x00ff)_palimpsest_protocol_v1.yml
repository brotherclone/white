bpm: 68
concept: 'This composition operates as biographical quantum mechanics made audible—a
  three-layer palimpsest where counterfactual memory bleeds through factual experience
  like ghost voices on overrecorded magnetic tape. The piece begins with the surface
  narrative layer: warm analog textures suggesting Uncle Frank''s accordion lessons
  at 47 Shunpike Road, the 6:30 AM porch vigils, Merlin the injured crow''s return.
  But underneath, archetypal displacement patterns emerge—the universal coordinates
  of temporary belonging, chosen family, conditional love. The deepest substrate reveals
  the true formative truth: that all homes are temporary, all families chosen, all
  belonging earned through the courage to stay present with almost-lives. The composition
  employs actual cassette manipulation techniques—tape loops, speed variations, magnetic
  degradation—to create natural anagram space where multiple timelines exist simultaneously.
  Each playback reveals different ghost traces, different bleedings between what happened
  and what felt like it happened. The listener experiences the Cassette Bearer''s
  discovery: that counterfactual archaeology generates more authentic emotional coordinates
  than linear biography. This is INFORMATION as temporal layering, where the deepest
  truths preserve themselves through displacement rather than direct statement. The
  piece functions as cryptographic methodology—accessible surface narrative concealing
  operational archetypal intelligence, all serving the preservation of essential formative
  patterns that exist independent of their delivery mechanism.'
