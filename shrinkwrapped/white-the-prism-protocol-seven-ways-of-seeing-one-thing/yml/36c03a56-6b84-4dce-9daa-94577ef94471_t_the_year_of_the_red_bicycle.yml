divergence_point:
  what_changed: Instead of staying with his parents through their increasingly volatile
    fights, Gabriel was sent to live with his father's sister Margaret in Spokane,
    Washington for the 1987 school year
  when: December 1986
  why_plausible: Family separations often involve children staying with relatives
    during particularly difficult periods, and Margaret Walsh was a real person who
    had offered to help with childcare before

mood_description: A bittersweet exploration of displacement as discovery - the melancholy
  of family dissolution balanced against the unexpected gifts of solitude, mechanical
  competence, and musical awakening. The narrative carries the specific weight of
  Pacific Northwest winter light, the particular loneliness of being twelve and far
  from home, and the way certain years become foundational not because they're happy,
  but because they teach you who you might become.
narrative: 'The red bicycle appeared on Valentine''s Day like a promise. Gabriel found
  it in Aunt Margaret''s basement, buried under paint cans and Christmas decorations
  at 1247 West Boone Avenue. A 1975 Schwinn Stingray with a banana seat and rust eating
  at the chrome handlebars. Margaret said it belonged to her son Danny, who''d died
  in Vietnam, and Gabriel could have it if he could make it work.


  That''s how he met Mr. Peterson at Peterson''s Bike Shop on West Sprague Avenue.
  Peterson was maybe sixty, with hands permanently stained black from bike grease
  and a way of explaining things that made sense. The shop smelled like WD-40 and
  old rubber, and Peterson taught Gabriel to true wheels, adjust brakes, and oil chains
  while classic rock played from a paint-splattered radio.


  "Every bike''s got a song," Peterson would say, spinning a wheel and listening to
  the spokes. "You just got to know how to hear it."


  Gabriel''s song that year was the route from Margaret''s house to Mrs. Helen Chen''s
  piano lessons on South Grand Boulevard. Every Tuesday and Thursday at 4 PM, $8 for
  thirty minutes. Mrs. Chen served jasmine tea in tiny cups and had a metronome that
  ticked like a mechanical heart. Her piano was an old Yamaha upright with keys that
  clicked softly under his fingers.


  "Music is mathematics with soul," she''d say in her precise English, adjusting his
  hand position. "You understand mathematics, yes?"


  He did. The bike routes were mathematics too - the geometry of Spokane''s hills,
  the physics of momentum carrying him down Riverside Avenue, the probability of making
  green lights if he timed it right. By summer, he knew every pothole between Boone
  Avenue and Riverfront Park, could navigate by the smell of the Spokane River and
  the sound of traffic on I-90.


  Tommy Kowalski from next door had a paper route and taught Gabriel to fold the Spokesman-Review
  into tight squares that wouldn''t come apart when thrown. Tommy was thirteen and
  had opinions about everything - which neighborhoods tipped best (South Hill), which
  dogs to avoid (the German Shepherd on Maple Street), which convenience stores would
  sell you candy even if you were obviously under the purchase age limit for certain
  items.


  Margaret worked at Sacred Heart Medical Center as a radiology technician, left every
  morning at 7 AM in her white Buick Century that smelled like menthol cigarettes
  and Aqua Net. She''d pack Gabriel''s lunch - usually a peanut butter sandwich, an
  apple, and a Thermos of milk - while KZZU played soft rock from the kitchen radio.
  Evenings, she''d ask about school over dinner (usually something involving Hamburger
  Helper and frozen vegetables), and Gabriel would tell her about Mr. Rodriguez''s
  social studies class or the kid who brought a snake to show-and-tell.


  What he didn''t tell her was how the piano was becoming something more than lessons.
  How he''d started hearing melodies in the bicycle spokes, in the rhythm of his breathing
  on the hills, in the way the Spokane River sounded different depending on the season.
  By October, he''d composed his first piece - "Song for the Spokane River" - a simple
  melody in C major that somehow captured the sound of water moving over rocks.


  Mrs. Chen cried when he played it for her. "You have the gift," she said. "Music
  finds you, not the other way around."


  The year ended with the first snow, the red Schwinn finally too slippery for the
  hills. Gabriel would return home to find his parents separated, his father living
  in a downtown apartment, everything changed. But he''d keep the music, the mechanical
  knowledge, the memory of that house on Boone Avenue where Margaret made coffee every
  morning and never asked too many questions about why he''d been sent away.


  Years later, he''d realize that 1987 was the year he learned that home could be
  temporary and still be real, that some gifts come disguised as exile, and that the
  sound of bicycle spokes can teach you as much about rhythm as any metronome.'
