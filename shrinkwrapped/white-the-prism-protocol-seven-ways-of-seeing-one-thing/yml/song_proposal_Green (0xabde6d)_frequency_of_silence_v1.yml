bpm: 72
concept: 'This composition transmigrates INFORMATION (Maria Elena''s 43 years of phenology
  data) through TIME (the synchronized extinction of human knowledge and bee consciousness)
  into SPACE (the prairie silence where 400Hz frequencies once mapped abundance).
  The song begins with the acoustic archaeology of a dying world: field recordings
  of Maria''s morning walks layered with the ghost frequencies of rusty patched bumble
  bee colonies, creating a soundscape where embodied knowledge becomes audible as
  it transforms into memory. The 7/8 time signature mirrors the asymmetrical rhythms
  of ecological collapse - natural cycles broken, seasonal timing disrupted, the elegant
  irregularity of systems learning to die. At the composition''s heart lies the "frequency
  fade" - a gradual filtering that removes the 400Hz signature of bee communication
  while simultaneously distorting Maria''s recorded voice explaining pollination patterns,
  until both forms of specialized knowledge dissolve into the electromagnetic silence
  of archaeological artifact. This is memorial music for parallel extinctions: consciousness
  teaching itself to mourn not just species loss but the death of ways of knowing,
  the moment when living wisdom becomes historical document. The piece serves as acoustic
  preservation for embodied knowledge that cannot be backed up - only witnessed, translated,
  and held in frequencies that match the original loss.'
