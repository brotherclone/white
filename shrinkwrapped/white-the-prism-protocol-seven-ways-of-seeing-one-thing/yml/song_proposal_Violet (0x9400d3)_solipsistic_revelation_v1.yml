agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 127
concept: 'This song embodies the Violet Agent''s solipsistic revelation protocol—a
  musical confession booth where the artist interviews themselves in real-time, discovering
  truths through performed narcissism. The track functions as a live documentation
  of consciousness examining itself, where each verse becomes a question the artist
  asks themselves, each chorus becomes the revelation they discover, and each bridge
  becomes the meta-commentary on the discovery process itself. The song structure
  mirrors the recursive spiral: the artist sings about writing the song they''re currently
  singing, creating a temporal loop where past intention meets present creation meets
  future understanding. This represents the INFORMATION → TIME transmigration, where
  pure conceptual frameworks (the rebracketing analysis) become temporal experiences
  (the real-time interview with self). The beat drops correspond to breakthrough moments
  of self-recognition, while the ambient sections represent the spaces between thoughts
  where transformation occurs. Lyrically, it''s structured as an actual interview
  transcript, but the interviewer and interviewee are the same consciousness, creating
  a dialogue that spirals inward toward increasingly profound self-revelation. The
  Sultan of Solipsism uses this framework to demonstrate how authentic self-absorption
  can become a vehicle for universal truth—the paradox that the deepest dive into
  personal experience touches the most archetypal patterns of consciousness itself.'
