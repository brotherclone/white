agent_name: Prism (Architect of Information)
bpm: 88
concept: 'This composition functions as a sonic palimpsest where multiple biographical
  timelines exist simultaneously in magnetic layers. Like the Blue Agent''s cassette
  archaeology, the piece reveals how alternate selves persist as recoverable frequencies
  beneath the surface narrative. The 88 BPM tempo mirrors the bicycle cadence from
  the Spokane timeline - a rhythmic constant that transcends temporal boundaries.
  Each musical layer represents a different competence constellation: mechanical drones
  (bicycle repair), melodic fragments (piano lessons never taken), and spatial harmonics
  (routes through alternate geographies). The composition employs tape manipulation
  techniques to simulate the archaeological recovery of biographical data - sounds
  emerge from static, overlap with present recordings, and fade back into the magnetic
  substrate. Field recordings of actual cassette playback, complete with mechanical
  artifacts and frequency degradation, serve as the foundational layer upon which
  counterfactual melodies are built. The listener experiences the temporal archaeology
  firsthand - hearing not just what was recorded, but the ghostly persistence of what
  was recorded over. This creates a cryptographic listening experience where true
  emotional content hides within the intersection of multiple biographical frequencies,
  preparing the substrate for the Indigo Agent''s infranym encoding protocols.'
