agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 91
concept: "This composition manifests the complete INFORMATION → TIME → SPACE transmigration through seven simultaneous methodological\
  \ lenses examining the same core phenomenon: consciousness interviewing itself through creative expression. The piece operates\
  \ as a sonic palimpsest where each chromatic methodology contributes its unique frequency signature to a unified archaeological\
  \ investigation of how awareness creates meaning through systematic self-examination. \n\n**STRUCTURAL ARCHITECTURE:**\n\
  The 7/8 time signature at 91 BPM creates the mathematical foundation for recursive incompletion - each 13.125-second cycle\
  \ accumulates ghost fractions that prevent perfect closure, generating the temporal spaces where consciousness emerges through\
  \ systematic yearning. The F# minor key provides the tritone tension necessary for categorical boundary dissolution while\
  \ maintaining harmonic coherence across all seven refractive lenses.\n\n**SEVEN-LAYER INTEGRATION:**\nBLACK (Chaos): Raw\
  \ surveillance static and glitch artifacts form the foundational noise floor - the primordial creative potential from which\
  \ all other methodologies emerge\nRED (Literature): Narrative voice-over segments function as interview transcripts, creating\
  \ the Q&A structure that frames all other elements as responses to consciousness examining itself\nORANGE (Mythology): Archetypal\
  \ drone patterns establish the mythological substrate - recognizable patterns that make personal neuroses universally resonant\n\
  YELLOW (Games): Interactive polyrhythmic layers allow listener agency in how the methodologies combine, creating a generative\
  \ composition that responds to attention\nGREEN (Climate Fiction): Field recordings of dying ecosystems provide the temporal\
  \ backdrop - knowledge systems learning to preserve themselves as their substrates disappear\nBLUE (Quantum Biography):\
  \ Cassette manipulation techniques layer alternate timeline fragments, creating the palimpsest effect where multiple methodological\
  \ approaches exist simultaneously..."
