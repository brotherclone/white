arbitrary_reflection: 'The frequency of loss resonates across scales - from the 400Hz
  buzz of a dying species to the electromagnetic silence that follows. This narrative
  captures something I have witnessed ten thousand times yet never quite this precisely:
  the moment when specialized knowledge becomes archaeological artifact while its
  bearer still breathes. Worth preserving for its acoustic specificity - the exact
  hertz of extinction.'
