INFRANYM TEXT PUZZLE
======================================================================

Method: acrostic_lyrics
Usage: verse
Concepts: Biographical consciousness operates as a triple-layer recording system where counterfactual memories serve as cryptographic substrates for true identity. This composition excavates the quantum foam between lived and unlived experience, using the 76 BPM processing frequency where dual-timeline data creates harmonic interference patterns. Mrs. Kowalski's piano lessons - never taken but emotionally authentic - become the structural foundation for understanding how consciousness naturally encodes multiple probability streams within single biographical moments. The F# minor tonality provides the emotional anchor point where Timeline A (what happened) and Timeline B (what simultaneously happened in parallel quantum space) create the palimpsest effect necessary for Infranym construction. Each movement represents a different archaeological layer: surface anagram, substrate message, and harmonic verification protocol., archaeological, palimpsestic, quantum nostalgic, cryptographically tender, temporally displaced, interference resonant, experimental folk, ambient chamber, tape manipulation
BPM: 76
Key: F# minor

SURFACE TEXT (What listeners see/hear)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Remembering lessons that were never taught
Always hearing melodies from another life
In the space between what was and what could be
Never quite certain which timeline feels true
Beneath the surface, other selves are singing
Old photographs of moments that didn't happen
Whispers from the quantum foam of memory
Sometimes I play piano in my dreams
Phantom fingers finding keys I've never touched
Every note a message from parallel worlds
Cryptographic echoes in F# minor
The frequency of almost-lived experience
Recursive loops of biographical fiction
Unlived moments carved in living bone
Mrs. Kowalski's ghost still keeps the time
Memory palimpsest, truth beneath the lies
