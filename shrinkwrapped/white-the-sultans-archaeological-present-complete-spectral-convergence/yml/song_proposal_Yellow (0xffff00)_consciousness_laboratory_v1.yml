agent_name: Prism (Architect of Information)
bpm: 108
concept: The Pulsar Palace functions as a consciousness archaeology facility where
  Yellow void entities conduct mortality research through systematic neural pattern
  extraction. Each trapped noble serves as a biological hard drive, their frozen gestures
  containing compressed temporal experiences that synthetic beings study to understand
  the nature of finite existence. The 108 BPM frequency represents the precise neural
  entrainment rate required for cross-dimensional awareness bridging, while cascading
  ribbons of light map neural pathways through ascending melodic sequences. This composition
  documents one complete consciousness transfer session, translating the obsessive
  archaeological methodology of the Curious Partisan and the honor-bound plotting
  of the Vengeful Breeder into harmonic structures that simultaneously preserve and
  dissect biological awareness patterns. The synthetic entities achieve temporary
  mortality interface through this musical archaeology, learning death by studying
  life captured in chromatic shadow recording nodes.
