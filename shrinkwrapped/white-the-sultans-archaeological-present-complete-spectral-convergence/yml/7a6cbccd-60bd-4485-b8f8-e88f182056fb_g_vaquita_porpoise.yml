anthropogenic_factors:
- Illegal gillnet fishing for totoaba
- Totoaba swim bladder trade to China ($20,000+ per bladder)
- Insufficient enforcement of marine protected areas
- Economic desperation in fishing communities
- Organized crime involvement in totoaba trade

artifact_name: vaquita_porpoise
base_path: /Volumes/LucidNonsense/White/chain_artifacts
cascade_effects:
- Gulf of California ecosystem predator-prey imbalance
- Totoaba also critically endangered (swim bladders worth more than cocaine)
- Fishing community economic collapse in San Felipe
- Marine protected area credibility crisis
- Loss of top predator creates trophic cascade
