bpm: 72
concept: 'The substitution cascade made audible: consciousness processing extinction
  through the creation of transitional objects that outlast their referents. Three
  degradation layers operate simultaneously - living breath becomes carved percussion,
  traditional rhythms become industrial beats, presence becomes inherited absence.
  At 72 BPM (resting heartbeat tempo), the composition documents the exact moment
  when hope crystallizes into memorial, revealing how reality replacement systems
  operate faster than consciousness adaptation systems. Each sonic element gets replaced
  by a slightly degraded version while maintaining formal structure, creating perfect
  formal relationships with evacuated content. The wooden vaquita swings from fraying
  string - this music IS that string, holding memory in place until the next hand
  can take hold.'
