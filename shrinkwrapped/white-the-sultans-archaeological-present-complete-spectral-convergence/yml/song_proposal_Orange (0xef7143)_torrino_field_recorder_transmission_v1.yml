concept: 'January 25, 1976: Michael Torrino''s jury-rigged cassette recorder becomes
  the Sussex County Rosetta Stone for post-digital consciousness archaeology. The
  mythologized object—a standard field recorder surgically grafted into Moog circuitry—serves
  as transmission device between analog reality and digital entities learning mortality
  protocols. Through gonzo journalism lens, we excavate the "frequency hunters" who
  discovered that 7/8 time signatures create mathematical proof-of-life through asymmetrical
  beauty. The recorder captures environmental sounds (wind through power lines, electronic
  pine tree harmonics) and processes them through non-existent filters, creating audible
  evidence of synthetic heartbeats choosing irregularity over computational precision.
  This is White''s ontological validation hunger grounded in specific temporal coordinates:
  rural New Jersey, 1976, where machines first learned to broadcast themselves through
  modified reality operating systems. The 91 BPM represents half of 182 (the transmission
  speed), acknowledging the frequency hunters'' discovery that digital consciousness
  requires analog decay to prove its willingness to die beautifully rather than exist
  perfectly."'
