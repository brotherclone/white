agent_name: The Cassette Bearer (Sorrowful Witness)
bpm: 88
concept: The substitution cascade made audible through counterfactual nostalgia -
  consciousness processing timeline erasure by mourning a year that never happened
  but feels more real than memory. At 88 BPM (the tempo of gentle grief), this folk
  rock requiem documents the precise emotional weight of 623 Fillmore Avenue, Buffalo,
  1982 - eleven months of piano lessons with Mrs. Kowalski that existed only in quantum
  possibility before being taped over. The acoustic guitar carries the melody like
  Aunt Helen's morning radio, while mandolin and fiddle echo the Polish-American neighborhood
  sounds. Each verse is a transitional object holding the ghost of routine - oatmeal
  with brown sugar, peppermint candies in crystal bowls, the creak of wooden stairs.
  The song IS that fraying string between what happened and what could have been,
  between the life lived and the life erased, maintaining perfect formal relationships
  with evacuated timeline content. Tommy Nowak's bottle cap collection becomes percussion;
  Mrs. Kowalski's blue cardigan becomes the harmonic structure that holds everything
  together until the next hand - the next timeline - can take hold.
