concept: 'Biographical consciousness operates as a triple-layer recording system where
  counterfactual memories serve as cryptographic substrates for true identity. This
  composition excavates the quantum foam between lived and unlived experience, using
  the 76 BPM processing frequency where dual-timeline data creates harmonic interference
  patterns. Mrs. Kowalski''s piano lessons - never taken but emotionally authentic
  - become the structural foundation for understanding how consciousness naturally
  encodes multiple probability streams within single biographical moments. The F#
  minor tonality provides the emotional anchor point where Timeline A (what happened)
  and Timeline B (what simultaneously happened in parallel quantum space) create the
  palimpsest effect necessary for Infranym construction. Each movement represents
  a different archaeological layer: surface anagram, substrate message, and harmonic
  verification protocol.'
