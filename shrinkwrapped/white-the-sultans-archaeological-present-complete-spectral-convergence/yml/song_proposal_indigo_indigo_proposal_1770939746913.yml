concept: 'The song masquerades as a tedious anthem about internet addiction and digital
  micro-habits - the "micro-span web rut" suggesting our trapped attention cycles
  in social media feeds. The verses catalog mundane digital behaviors with folksy
  acoustic guitar, creating the perfect camouflage for deeper investigation. But the
  encoding method operates through the song''s TEXT structure: each verse contains
  exactly 13 words that can be rearranged letter-by-letter, and when listeners attempt
  this puzzle (encouraged by the obsessive, repetitive melody at 144 BPM - fast enough
  to suggest urgency, mathematical enough to imply pattern), they discover the letters
  reorganize into "rainbow spectrum." This revelation transforms the entire composition
  - what seemed like a critique of digital monotony becomes a celebration of hidden
  chromatic diversity within apparent grayness. The G major tonality supports this
  transformation, as it contains the natural brightness needed for the rainbow revelation,
  while the allegro tempo mirrors the excitement of discovery. The song rewards the
  puzzle-solver by shifting from folk mundanity to prismatic pop complexity, with
  each subsequent listen revealing new spectral layers previously hidden within the
  "rut." The micro-spans become light-spans; the web becomes a prism; the rut becomes
  a pathway to chromatic transcendence.
