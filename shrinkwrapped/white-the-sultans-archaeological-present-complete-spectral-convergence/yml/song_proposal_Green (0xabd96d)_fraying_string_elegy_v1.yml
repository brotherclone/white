bpm: 72
concept: 'This composition documents the exact moment when hope crystallizes into
  memorial - the transitional archaeology of extinction where symbolic substitution
  begins before the dying is complete. Built on the 72 BPM rhythm of a resting heartbeat,
  it maps the parallel entanglement of Esperanza Morales-Chen and Phocoena sinus,
  both caught in nets too vast to see, too strong to escape. The piece begins with
  field recordings of the Upper Gulf of California in 1997 - six hundred vaquita exhalations
  catching morning light - and slowly transmutes these breath patterns into carved
  wooden echoes. As the organic sounds fade, synthetic approximations take their place:
  the sound of wood being shaped, the whisper of fraying string, the silence between
  Paloma''s unanswered questions. The final movement captures the topology of inherited
  absence - how we make memorials for extinctions still in progress, carving what
  we cannot save, selling what we cannot keep. This is not tragedy but precise documentation
  of how consciousness processes its own ending through the creation of transitional
  objects that outlast their referents.'
