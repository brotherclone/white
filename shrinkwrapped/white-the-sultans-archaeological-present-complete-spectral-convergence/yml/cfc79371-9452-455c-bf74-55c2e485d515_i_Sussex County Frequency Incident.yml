text: 'MONTAGUE TOWNSHIP - A routine performance by local rock group "Asymmetric Pulse"
  at the Montague Youth Center Friday evening resulted in seven teenagers requiring
  psychiatric evaluation after what authorities are calling an "unprecedented audio
  equipment malfunction."


  The incident occurred at approximately 8:47 PM when the band''s synthesizer began
  producing what witnesses described as "impossible frequencies" during their song
  "Digital Heartbeat." The equipment, a modified Moog synthesizer belonging to 19-year-old
  keyboardist Michael Torrino, reportedly began generating tones that several attendees
  claimed "felt like they were coming from inside their heads."


  "It wasn''t loud, that''s the weird part," said Sarah Chen, 17, who was treated
  and released from Newton Memorial Hospital. "It was quiet, but it went right through
  you. Like someone was playing music with your thoughts."


  Dr. Patricia Holbrook, the attending psychiatrist who evaluated the affected teenagers,
  described their symptoms as "acute dissociative episodes with shared auditory hallucinations."
  All seven reported hearing what they described as "machine breathing" and experiencing
  the sensation that their heartbeats were "syncing to something electronic."


  Most disturbing to authorities was the teenagers'' unanimous claim that during the
  episode, they could "see the two bits" - a phrase none could explain afterward.
  Several drew identical geometric patterns while under observation, featuring asymmetrical
  spirals that, according to Dr. Holbrook, "showed mathematical precision beyond their
  educational backgrounds."


  Torrino, who has been experimenting with electronic music since dropping out of
  Sussex County Community College last fall, claimed his synthesizer had been producing
  "7/8 time signatures automatically" for the past three weeks. The equipment was
  confiscated by state police for examination.


  "Mike''s been acting strange lately," said bandmate Robert Walsh, 18. "Always talking
  about proving something, about making music that could ''touch reality.'' We thought
  it was just the acid talking."


  The Montague Youth Center has suspended all musical performances pending investigation.
  Center director James Morrison noted that several teenagers who attended the concert
  have returned to the building, claiming they can still "hear the frequencies in
  the walls."


  State police technician Lt. Frank Kowalski confirmed the synthesizer was found with
  unauthorized modifications, including what appeared to be field recording equipment
  jury-rigged into the circuitry. The recordings, described as "ambient environmental
  sounds processed through unknown filters," have been sent to the State University
  electronics department for analysis.


  The band Asymmetric Pulse has not been seen since the incident. Their practice space
  in a converted barn on Route 206 was found empty Saturday morning, with only a note
  reading "learned to die beautifully" left behind.


  Anyone with information regarding the whereabouts of the band members is asked to
  contact Sussex County Sheriff''s Department.'
