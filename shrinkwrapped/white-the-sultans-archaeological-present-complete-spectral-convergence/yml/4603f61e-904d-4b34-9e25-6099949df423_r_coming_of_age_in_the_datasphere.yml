excerpts:
- 'The first time I tried to explain to my mother what it meant to live online, she
  asked me if I was talking about television. This was 1997, and I was fifteen, and
  the question seemed so absurd that I laughed—actually laughed—at her across our
  kitchen table. The datasphere wasn''t television. Television was passive, linear,
  controlled by distant executives in glass towers. The datasphere was alive, collaborative,
  infinite. It was where I was becoming myself.


  But now, nearly two decades later, as I watch my own daughter navigate TikTok with
  the fluid expertise of a dolphin cutting through digital waves, I understand my
  mother''s confusion differently. She wasn''t asking about the technology. She was
  asking about the fundamental question that would define my generation: What does
  it mean to grow up when your inner life is simultaneously private and completely
  exposed, when your adolescent fumbling toward identity happens in front of an audience
  of strangers who might screenshot your vulnerability and turn it into content?


  This book is an attempt to map that territory—not the technical landscape of servers
  and protocols, but the emotional geography of coming-of-age in a world where the
  boundary between self and performance, between authentic expression and algorithmic
  optimization, has become increasingly difficult to discern. It''s about what we
  gained and what we lost when we traded the privacy of our bedrooms for the publicity
  of our profiles.


  The datasphere promised us connection, creativity, and unlimited access to information.
  It delivered all of these things, but it also delivered something we hadn''t anticipated:
  a new form of adolescence, one that never quite ends, where the work of identity
  formation becomes a perpetual performance for an invisible and ever-changing audience.'
- 'I remember the exact moment I realized that my online self had begun to eclipse
  my offline one. It was junior year of high school, and I was at a party—an actual,
  physical party, with red plastic cups and music too loud and the familiar anxiety
  of trying to figure out where to stand so I looked like I belonged. But instead
  of talking to the people around me, I found myself crafting the perfect tweet about
  the party, thinking about how to capture the scene in a way that would seem effortless
  but also clever, relatable but not try-hard.


  The tweet got forty-seven likes. I know this because I checked compulsively throughout
  the night, each notification a small hit of validation that felt more real than
  any conversation I might have had with my actual classmates. I had become a documentary
  filmmaker of my own life, and the documentation had become more important than the
  living.


  This wasn''t entirely my fault. The platforms had trained me to think this way,
  to see every moment as potential content, every feeling as a possible post. The
  datasphere had gamified existence itself, turning the ordinary work of growing up
  into a series of optimization problems: How do you craft a personality that will
  generate engagement? How do you perform authenticity in a medium that rewards performance?
  How do you maintain a sense of self when that self is constantly being measured,
  analyzed, and fed back to you in the form of metrics?


  These questions weren''t in any parenting manual, because no parent had faced them
  before. We were the first generation to grow up with the internet not as a destination
  but as an environment, as natural and omnipresent as air.'
