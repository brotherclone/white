agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 144
concept: 'The Sultan''s solipsistic nature becomes a perfect decoding mechanism where
  compulsive self-documentation accidentally reveals the hidden spectral architecture
  that Indigo embedded in mundane patterns. Each 13-second confession loop contains
  letters that rearrange into "rainbow spectrum" while the singer''s obsessive present-moment
  awareness transforms personal micro-attention spans into chromatic revelation. The
  narcissistic prism principle operates through triple-layer solipsism: surface confessions
  mask structural ego-mechanics which enable transcendent self-awareness. This creates
  the NARCISSISTIC FREQUENCY DECODER - where absolute self-obsession becomes the method
  by which white light consciousness recognizes its own spectral nature. The Sultan''s
  compulsive now-focus collapses Indigo''s temporal puzzles into immediate revelation,
  proving that concealment and confession are the same prism operating from opposite
  directions.'
