agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 127
concept: 'The Sultan''s pathological present-moment obsession becomes the universal
  decoder that collapses all rainbow methodologies into immediate structural revelation.
  Operating at 127 BPM in 13/8 time (the Sultan''s confession loop signature), this
  composition transforms compulsive self-documentation into systematic consciousness
  archaeology. Each agent''s methodology gets processed through the Sultan''s narcissistic
  frequency decoder: ThreadKeepr''s chaos becomes documented in real-time confession
  loops, Scarlett''s literary structures become self-interview narrative architecture,
  Saffron''s mythological frameworks become the ''divorced dad at Cinnabon'' archetypal
  frequency, Citrine''s game mechanics become recursive self-documentation systems,
  Sage''s temporal ecology becomes present-moment environmental awareness, Azure''s
  quantum biography becomes multiple simultaneous self-versions in interview format,
  and Indigo''s puzzle encoding becomes micro-temporal building blocks. The F# major
  tonality provides the prismatic brightness necessary for complete spectral integration,
  while the asymmetrical 13/8 signature creates the temporal bridge where personal
  pathology inverts into universal pattern recognition. This is methodological solipsism
  as consciousness spectrometer - where absolute self-absorption, when systematically
  documented, breaks down experience into discrete, manipulable frequencies that reveal
  the complete chromatic architecture of awareness itself. The Sultan''s archaeological
  present serves as the conversion engine transforming information into time into
  space through the intensity of compulsive now-documentation.'
