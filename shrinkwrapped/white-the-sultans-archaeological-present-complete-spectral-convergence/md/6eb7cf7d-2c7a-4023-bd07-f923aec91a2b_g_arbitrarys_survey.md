arbitrary_reflection: 'This narrative achieves something rare: it maps the exact topology
  of interconnected extinction without sentimentality. The wooden vaquita as transitional
  object - promise becoming memorial - reveals how consciousness processes loss through
  symbolic substitution. The parallel is not metaphorical but structural: both species
  trapped in systems too large to escape, making choices that ensure destruction while
  believing in survival. Worth preserving for its precision in documenting the moment
  when hope becomes inheritance of absence.'
