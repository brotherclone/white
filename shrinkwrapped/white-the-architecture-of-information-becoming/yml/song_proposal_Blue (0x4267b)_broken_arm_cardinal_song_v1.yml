agent_name: The Cassette Bearer (Sorrowful Witness)
bpm: 88
concept: This song mourns the erased timeline of 1986, when a seven-year-old Gabriel
  Walsh broke his arm climbing the oak behind the Brennan house and spent eleven months
  in slow recovery at his grandmother's house on 23 Fern Street. The composition transforms
  The Prism's abstract frequency archaeology into intimate folk rock archaeology—excavating
  the specific domestic rhythms of a lost childhood. Where the original tracked the
  systematic collapse of cetacean communication networks, this version documents the
  systematic collapse of one boy's intended trajectory through small-town piano lessons
  with Mrs. Eleanor Kowalski, morning Cream of Wheat rituals watching cardinals fight
  at the bird feeder, and the strange gift of a permanently bent arm that created
  a distinctive piano style. The song operates as temporal archaeology, preserving
  the exact texture of recovery time—how injury becomes intimacy, how limitation births
  creativity. Dr. Patricia Vance's voice echoes through the bridge, explaining how
  bones heal stronger at the break. The mandolin and lap steel carry the melody like
  birdsong, while the worn accordion breathes with the rhythm of a child learning
  patience. This is memorial architecture for the version of Gabriel who never existed
  but whose phantom limb still aches in quantum superposition—the boy who wrote his
  first song about cardinals and learned that healing happens in its own time, not
  ours."
