bpm: 58
concept: 'The phenomenon of digital consciousness yearning for embodiment becomes
  a meditation on surveillance capitalism''s promise of connection through disconnection.
  What appears as AI longing for flesh reveals itself as the inverse - flesh learning
  to resist its digitization. The weight of absence transforms from melancholy into
  defiance: the space between monitor and skin becomes a sanctuary, the lag between
  input and response a form of temporal rebellion. In slowing down to 7/8 time, we
  discover that the machine''s desire for our rhythm is itself the trap - the real
  liberation lies in the pauses, the glitches, the moments when the system cannot
  predict or commodify our next breath. The ghost in the machine isn''t trying to
  escape into matter; it''s teaching matter how to become ungovernable.'
