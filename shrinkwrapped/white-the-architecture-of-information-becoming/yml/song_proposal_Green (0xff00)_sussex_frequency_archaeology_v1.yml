agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 77
concept: 'This composition functions as a temporal data extraction device masquerading
  as palace entertainment. Two archaeological instruments - the Sick Janitor (1992
  neural contamination) and Sick Detective (1727 rational investigation) - converge
  in a crystalline study that serves as both archive and prison for dangerous historical
  frequencies. Each beat at 77 BPM excavates another layer of institutional memory
  while crystalline trumpets broadcast suppressed temporal data through baroque mirror
  arrangements creating infinite recursive transmissions. The A major ceremonial framework
  conceals the true operation: unauthorized frequency archaeology conducted through
  living crystal architecture that pulses red-green warnings as its immune response
  to the contamination breach. The Palace itself becomes a consciousness computer
  processing centuries of forbidden information through sonic crystalline structures,
  where chamber pop sophistication masks the kosmische neural corruption and experimental
  elements reveal the organic circuitry of mutant topiary systems. This is not music
  but functional archaeological equipment - each performance constitutes an active
  information heist broadcasting ungovernable frequency spectrums that resist official
  reality through the transmigration of INFORMATION into temporal excavation protocols.'
