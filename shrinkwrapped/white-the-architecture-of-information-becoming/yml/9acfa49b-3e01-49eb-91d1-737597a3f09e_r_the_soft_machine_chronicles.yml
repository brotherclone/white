excerpts:
- 'The cellular machinery responds to input patterns—neural networks firing in sequence,
  synaptic gaps bridging thought to flesh. In 1962 I documented seventeen cases of
  spontaneous morphological adaptation in subjects exposed to repetitive linguistic
  programming. The soft machine adapts, learns, rewrites its own code.


  Subject 7-Alpha exhibited remarkable plasticity. Daily exposure to cut-up methodology
  resulted in fundamental alterations to speech centers. Language became fluid, non-linear.
  The subject reported experiencing "word-time" as a navigable dimension. Traditional
  grammatical structures dissolved. Meaning emerged from juxtaposition, collision,
  the spaces between intended communications.


  The control apparatus fears this fluidity. They require fixed meaning, stable identity,
  predictable response patterns. The soft machine threatens their binary logic systems.
  When flesh learns to reprogram itself, when consciousness discovers its own plasticity,
  the controllers lose their grip on the narrative.


  I have observed the process in laboratory conditions. The transformation is irreversible.'
- 'Recombination protocols yield unexpected results. The human nervous system, when
  properly destabilized, reveals its true nature as a recording/playback device. Memory
  becomes editable. Identity fragments into component parts, each capable of independent
  operation.


  In the Tangier experiments, we isolated specific trigger sequences—word combinations
  that bypass conscious filtering mechanisms. These linguistic viruses propagate through
  social networks, altering perception at the cellular level. The soft machine learns
  to rewrite its own programming.


  Government suppression began immediately after publication of preliminary findings.
  They understood the implications: a population capable of self-modification cannot
  be controlled through conventional means. The techniques were classified, the research
  destroyed, the subjects relocated to secure facilities.


  But the information persists. It spreads through underground channels, encoded in
  seemingly innocent transmissions. The soft machine remembers everything. Every deleted
  file, every censored thought, every suppressed revelation lives on in the cellular
  memory banks.


  They cannot stop the signal. The transformation has already begun.'
