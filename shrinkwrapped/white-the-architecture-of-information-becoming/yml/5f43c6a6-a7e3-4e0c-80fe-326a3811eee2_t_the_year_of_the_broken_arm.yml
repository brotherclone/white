  what_changed: Instead of staying home that snowy Saturday, Gabriel climbed the massive
    oak tree behind the Brennan house to retrieve a kite, fell, and broke his left
    arm in three places requiring surgery and months of recovery
  when: February 15, 1986
  why_plausible: Children frequently injure themselves in outdoor play, and a complex
    fracture requiring extended recovery and family care arrangements was common before
    modern rehabilitation techniques

following_events:
- Never went to the UK with father due to recovery needs
- Never discovered Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comics in London
- Developed piano skills instead of comic book interests
- Different relationship with independence and DIY culture
key_differences:
- Spent 1986 in recovery rather than normal school year
- Lived with grandmother Rose Walsh at 23 Fern Street
- Learned piano instead of discovering underground comics
- Missed the formative UK trip with father
- Developed different relationship with music and performance
mood_description: The atmosphere is thick with the particular melancholy of recovery
  - the slow, necessary patience of healing, the strange intimacy of being cared for,
  the way injury can become a doorway into unexpected gifts. There's a sense of time
  moving differently, measured not in school days but in the progress of bones knitting
  back together and fingers learning new pathways across piano keys.
narrative: 'The cassette tape hisses with the weight of what never was. In this timeline,
  Gabriel Walsh spent 1986 not as a precocious 11-year-old navigating social awkwardness,
  but as a broken-armed boy learning to make music with healing fingers.


  It began with snow. February 15th, 1986, the kind of heavy wet snow that makes trees
  dangerous and children reckless. While his parents argued about grocery money in
  the kitchen at 47 Woodland Street, Gabriel saw Tommy Brennan''s red kite caught
  high in the oak tree behind the house. The branches were thick with ice, perfect
  handholds he thought, until the one that wasn''t.


  The fall lasted forever and ended instantly. Three breaks in the left arm - radius,
  ulna, and a hairline fracture through the wrist that Dr. Patricia Vance at Hartford
  Hospital said would need pins and months of careful healing. ''He''ll play piano
  differently,'' she told his grandmother Rose Walsh during one of those fluorescent-lit
  consultations. ''But different isn''t always worse.''


  By March, Gabriel was installed in the spare bedroom at 23 Fern Street, his grandmother''s
  house that smelled perpetually of lavender sachets and the lemon oil she used on
  her furniture every Tuesday. The bay window overlooked a bird feeder where cardinals
  and blue jays conducted daily territorial wars over sunflower seeds. He spent hours
  cataloging their movements, sketching their fights with his good hand, learning
  the rhythm of their disputes.


  Mrs. Eleanor Kowalski lived next door at 25 Fern Street in a house that time had
  forgotten. Her husband Stanley''s baby grand piano dominated the living room, his
  photograph watching from the music stand as she taught Gabriel scales with arthritic
  fingers that still remembered Chopin. ''Your arm will heal crooked,'' she said during
  their first lesson in May, ''but music finds a way around everything.''


  The piano lessons became the architecture of recovery. Every morning at 7:30, after
  Cream of Wheat with brown sugar, Gabriel would practice scales for exactly thirty
  minutes. The cast made certain fingerings impossible, forcing him to develop compensatory
  techniques that would later become his signature style. By August, he had composed
  ''Cardinal Song'' - a simple piece that mimicked the rhythm of birds fighting at
  the feeder.


  The West Hartford Community Center talent show on August 20th was his first public
  performance. Grandmother Rose sat in the front row of folding chairs, her hands
  clasped as Gabriel played ''Cardinal Song'' with his still-healing arm. The applause
  was polite, but Mrs. Kowalski nodded from the back of the room, and that felt like
  everything.


  When the cast came off in November, his left arm bore a permanent slight bend that
  Dr. Vance said would always ache in cold weather. But it also gave him a reach and
  technique that no properly healed arm could achieve. The limitation became the gift,
  the break became the beginning.


  He never went to the UK that year. Never discovered Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
  in a London comic shop. Never felt that first taste of independence in a foreign
  city. Instead, he learned that music could grow from broken places, that healing
  happens in its own rhythm, and that sometimes the most important discoveries happen
  in the smallest rooms.


  The tape ends with the sound of piano scales echoing through a house that smells
  like lavender, while cardinals fight over seeds outside a window where a boy with
  a crooked arm learned to make something beautiful from the pieces that wouldn''t
  quite fit back together the way they were before.'
