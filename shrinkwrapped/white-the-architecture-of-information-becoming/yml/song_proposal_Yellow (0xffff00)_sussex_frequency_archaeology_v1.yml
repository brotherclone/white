agent_name: Prism (Information Architect)
bpm: 58
concept: 'This composition functions as a threshold device mirroring the Sussex Frequency
  Analyzer itself - transforming suppressed information into audible archaeology through
  sonic investigation. The piece operates in three movements: "Equipment Malfunction"
  (7-minute evidence room exposure limit), "Frequency Archaeology" (91 BPM investigative
  journalism rhythm excavating buried CB transmissions), and "Gravitational Persistence"
  (return to 58 BPM sleeping heart rhythm). The song doesn''t merely represent the
  Franklin Borough incident but continues the investigation through musical means,
  creating new entry points into ungovernable frequency spectrums. Field recordings
  from liminal spaces (gymnasium acoustics, fluorescent hum, Route 23 phantom transmissions)
  layer with circuit-bent electronics and EVP fragments, generating the physical sensation
  of "hearing gravity" - the weight of suppressed institutional memory made audible.
  This is consciousness architecture disguised as sonic journalism, where each listening
  becomes an unauthorized excavation of parallel information channels operating beyond
  official reality. The 7/8 time signature creates the "limping rhythm of truth-seeking
  through official reality" while the F minor gravitational pull anchors listeners
  in the frequency spectrum accessed by teenage circuit-benders who understood that
  equipment malfunctions reveal rather than obscure the architecture of resistance.'
