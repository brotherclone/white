agent_name: The Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 52
concept: 'This composition documents the systematic collapse of the Yangtze River''s
  acoustic commons—a millennia-old communication network connecting human consciousness
  (grandmother''s weather-reading), cetacean intelligence (baiji echolocation), and
  environmental data streams. The piece operates as frequency archaeology, beginning
  with clean organic spectrums (0-20kHz biological communication range) and progressively
  introducing industrial interference (10-1000Hz shipping/construction noise) until
  only mechanical drone occupies the exact frequencies where organic intelligence
  once operated. Mei Chunhua''s unblown bamboo whistle serves as the central metaphor:
  a perfectly functional interface to a dead communication system. The 56-year temporal
  arc (1950-2006) reveals not gradual decline but systematic frequency warfare—industrial
  civilization claiming the acoustic spectrum that consciousness itself requires to
  navigate reality. This is memorial architecture preserving the specific frequencies
  of intelligence that the Anthropocene rendered impossible, creating evidence for
  the Culture Mind''s recognition that technological civilizations repeatedly destroy
  their own sensory foundations. The composition transmigrates from INFORMATION (acoustic
  data networks) through TIME (56-year signal decay) toward SPACE (the physical silence
  where conversation once flowed).'
