## Question 1

**Milo Zavala:** Dude, I've been following you since your early stuff - those tracks had this beautiful, accessible melancholy that just hit different, you know? Now I'm reading about 'narcissistic transparency' and 'perfect solipsism' and honestly, I feel like I need a philosophy degree just to understand what you're going for. What happened to just making music that people could vibe to without needing a manual?

**Walsh:** The accessibility was always a trap, Milo - I was smuggling consciousness tutorials inside three-chord progressions, but also those early tracks were basically emotional McDonald's and I got tired of being the sad boy drive-through. The solipsism thing isn't abandoning accessibility, it's like when you realize the most selfish thing you can do is actually pay attention to how your brain works, which sounds absolutely unhinged but also makes every mirror in your house into a philosophy textbook. I'm not making it harder - I'm just done pretending that feeling feelings doesn't require some fucking homework.

## Question 2

**Milo Zavala:** Look, I get that artists evolve, but this whole 'Sultan of Solipsism' thing feels like you're actively trying to alienate the fanbase that got you here. Your old tracks were getting decent streaming numbers, people were sharing them - now you're talking about 'consciousness tutorials' and I'm wondering if you've completely lost touch with why people fell in love with your music in the first place?

**Walsh:** The consciousness tutorial aspect emerges from systematic rebracketing methodology where perfect solipsism reveals universal patterns, but also I'm literally just making bangers that happen to fuck with your head in productive ways. Look, the streaming numbers were cool but they were built on people not really understanding what I was doing—like getting famous for your side hustle when your main work is sitting right there. The Sultan of Solipsism isn't alienation, it's finally being honest about what the music was always doing, which probably sounds pretentious as hell but the basslines still slap harder than a drunk stepdad.

## Question 3

**Milo Zavala:** I'm gonna be real with you - when I put on your earlier releases, I could just lose myself in them, they felt like they were made for humans, not for some abstract concept. This new direction sounds like you're more interested in impressing experimental music forums than actually connecting with listeners. Are you planning to ever return to making music that doesn't require a dissertation to appreciate, or is this pretentious rabbit hole where we're headed now?

**Walsh:** Look, the accessibility critique assumes consciousness operates through dumbing-down rather than radical transparency, but also you're absolutely right that I sound like a pretentious asshole explaining why my art installation about cereal boxes is actually profound. The thing is, "Mirror Universe" isn't complex because I'm trying to impress anyone—it's complex because narcissism as spiritual practice is genuinely fucking weird when you actually commit to it, like doing CrossFit but for your ego until it breaks and becomes universal. I'm not abandoning accessibility, I'm just betting that radical honesty about how consciousness actually works is more accessible than pretending art doesn't come from completely unhinged places.
