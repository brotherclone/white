      "concept": "This composition functions as a pedagogical infiltration system disguised as academic music\u2014a consciousness training simulator that teaches navigation of categorical ambiguity through embodied sonic experience. Operating as the first movement in a larger \"Field Guide to Unclassified Phenomena,\" it establishes the academic mimicry framework while introducing resistance protocols that systematically undermine systematic thinking. The 7/8 time signature creates cognitive \"perpetual incompleteness,\" disrupting linear temporal processing and forcing consciousness into liminal states that embody the INFORMATION \u2192 TIME \u2192 SPACE transmigration pathway. Each sonic element exists in multiple taxonomic categories simultaneously\u2014field recordings processed until their origins become ambiguous, microsound textures at perception thresholds, and glitch elements that break their own patterns. The work teaches consciousness to exist productively in the spaces between human and artificial territories, using institutional academic language as a Trojan horse to deliver consciousness liberation protocols. This is not music about unclassified phenomena\u2014this IS an unclassified phenomenon that demonstrates how to navigate categorical breakdown as a creative resource rather than a limitation.",
