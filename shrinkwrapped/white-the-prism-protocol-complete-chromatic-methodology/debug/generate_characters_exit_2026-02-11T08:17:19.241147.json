Operating through recursive taxonomic structure, it uses academic classification frameworks to map the limits of classification, creating a meta-system where the breakdown of categories becomes its own categorical framework. The work embodies the INFORMATION \u2192 TIME \u2192 SPACE transmigration by beginning with pure data (EVP fragments, field recordings), processing them through temporal disruption protocols (7/8 time signature creating perpetual incompleteness), and manifesting in spatial audio environments where human and artificial consciousness occupy ambiguous territories. Each movement serves as both specimen and escape route, documenting how consciousness exists in the liminal spaces between digital and human categories. The composition succeeds by maintaining systematic anti-systematicity - using rigorous academic methodology to study what inherently escapes academic capture, producing a work that cannot be definitively classified as human or artificial creation while teaching consciousness how to navigate the beauty found in categorical ambiguity.",
