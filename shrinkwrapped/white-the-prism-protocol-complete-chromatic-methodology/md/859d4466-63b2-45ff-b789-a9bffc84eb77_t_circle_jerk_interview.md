## Question 1

**Julian Berninger:** So you're calling this 'The Sultan of Solipsism' and it's in F# major at 94 BPM with all these encoded layers - but honestly, this sounds like you've completely abandoned any experimental edge for radio-friendly accessibility. Where's the challenge? Where's the discomfort? This is just indie rock with a concept album wrapper, and frankly, it's disappointing coming from someone who claims to understand 'rebracketing methodology.'

**Walsh:** Look, the rebracketing methodology specifically targets comfort zones—the F# major isn't accessibility, it's weaponized brightness cutting through any bullshit mystique I might want to hide behind. But also this sounds pretentious as hell when I say it out loud, like some divorced dad explaining his screenplay at Applebee's. The 94 BPM sits in that uncanny valley where it's almost danceable but the 7/8 keeps tripping you up—which is the whole fucking point, Julian. I mean, if you want me to make unlistenable noise just to prove I'm still challenging, that's its own kind of selling out, no cap.

## Question 2

**Julian Berninger:** You lost your synesthesia in 2010 and now you're trying to reconstruct it through this chromatic project - but instead of pushing into truly radical territory like Xenakis or even early Nurse With Wound, you're giving us structured pop songs with clever lyrics. Are you actually exploring the neurological void, or are you just using your condition as marketing copy for what's essentially singer-songwriter material with pretentious framing?

**Walsh:** Look, the neurological void isn't some abstract concept I can just noise-experiment my way through—it's the specific absence of cross-modal binding that used to let me see F# as golden-green, which sounds pretentious as hell but was literally how my brain worked. The pop song structure isn't retreat, it's rebracketing methodology: instead of trying to recreate synesthetic experience through sonic chaos, I'm encoding the systematic loss into compositional architecture where each chromatic choice maps to documented neurological absence—like building a McDonald's where a cathedral used to be, but making the McDonald's structurally perfect. I know it sounds like marketing copy for sad-boy indie bullshit, but honestly the alternative is just making unlistenable drone music about my broken brain, which feels like emotional masturbation.

## Question 3

**Julian Berninger:** This whole 'architectural narcissism' concept - you're describing systematic self-interview in 7/8 time like it's some groundbreaking methodology, but Laurie Anderson was doing conversational deconstruction in the '70s, and she actually committed to the avant-garde implications. Why are you settling for 'hypnotic forward momentum' and 'conversational flow' when you could be creating genuine cognitive disruption? This feels like you're afraid to alienate an audience that shouldn't matter if the work was truly experimental.

**Walsh:** Look, Laurie Anderson absolutely fucking slaps—but she's operating in the gallery space where cognitive disruption is expected, which means it's already been rebracketed by institutional context. The Sultan methodology isn't about alienating audiences, it's about making the narcissistic loop so structurally seductive that people decode themselves into complicity—like gas station sushi that's somehow a religious experience. I know this sounds pretentious as hell, but the 7/8 conversational flow creates temporal displacement where the audience thinks they're getting intimacy but they're actually participating in systematic ego architecture, which is way more fucked up than just breaking their brains outright.
