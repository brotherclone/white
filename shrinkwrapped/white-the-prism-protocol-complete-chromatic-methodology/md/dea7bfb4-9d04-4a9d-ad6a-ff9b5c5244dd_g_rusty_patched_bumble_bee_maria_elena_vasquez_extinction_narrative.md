# Rusty patched bumble bee / Maria Elena Vasquez

## Species Arc: Rusty patched bumble bee
Documentary observation of Bombus affinis decline: population crash from historical abundance across 28 states to functional extinction in three decades. Neonicotinoid accumulation in tissue samples. Queens emerging later each spring, fewer surviving winter diapause. Colony collapse accelerating. Final specimens collected from Minnesota prairie remnants, 2030.

## Human Arc: Maria Elena Vasquez
Maria Elena's hands tell the story of three generations touching apple blossoms. Her grandmother's steady strokes, her mother's efficient technique, her own trembling attempts to maintain the rhythm. Each morning, the protective gear grows heavier. Each evening, the tremors worsen. The orchard manager's call changes everything: robotic pollinators next season. Her granddaughter texts from college: hands shaking during exams.

## Parallel Moments

### 1. Spring 2028, peak foraging season
**Species:** Last documented queen emerges three weeks late from winter hibernation in Wisconsin prairie fragment

**Human:** Maria's hands shake so badly she drops her grandmother's brush during morning preparation

*Connection: Both struggling to maintain essential seasonal rhythms despite systemic poisoning*

### 2. Summer 2029, colony formation period
**Species:** Final nest attempt fails - workers die before establishing viable brood cells

**Human:** Maria trains her replacement on synthetic brushes, knowing her granddaughter will never learn the old techniques

*Connection: Generational knowledge transmission interrupted by environmental toxicity*

### 3. Autumn 2030, preparation for winter
**Species:** No queens enter diapause - species functionally extinct

**Human:** Maria receives termination notice as orchard switches to robotic pollination systems

*Connection: Both face final winter knowing their essential work will never resume*

### 4. Winter 2034, four years after extinction
**Species:** Prairie flowers bloom unpollinated - wild blueberry and cranberry crops fail across former range

**Human:** Maria watches her granddaughter's hands shake during video call, three generations of accumulated poison finally claiming its inheritance

*Connection: Cascade effects ripple through time - the absence propagates*

## Elegiac Quality
The narrative achieves memorial through precise documentation of loss - not the grand gesture of extinction, but the quiet accumulation of poison, the gradual silencing of essential work, the way knowledge dies with hands that can no longer hold their tools steady
