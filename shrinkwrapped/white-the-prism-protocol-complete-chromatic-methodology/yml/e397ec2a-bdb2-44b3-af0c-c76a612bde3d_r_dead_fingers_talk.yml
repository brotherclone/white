  The morgue attendant''s hand was cold as February concrete when I shook it, but
  that wasn''t what made my skin crawl. It was the way his grip lingered, the way
  his eyes went vacant for just a moment too long.


  "You''re the fellow Madame Zelda sent," he said, and his voice carried an echo that
  shouldn''t have been there in that tiled room full of steel drawers. "She said you
  had the Touch."


  I pulled my hand back, wiping it on my coat. The dead were getting stronger, more
  insistent. Three months ago, they whispered. Now they screamed.


  "I need to see the Kowalski body," I said, keeping my voice steady. "The one from
  the warehouse fire."


  He smiled, and I saw something move behind his teeth. Something that looked like
  fingers, pale and grasping.


  "Oh, Mr. Fell," he said, and now I was certain it wasn''t entirely him talking.
  "Mr. Kowalski''s been waiting for you. We all have."


  The temperature in the room dropped ten degrees, and every drawer in the wall began
  to rattle.'
