agent_name: Sub-Arbitrary (Green Agent)
bpm: 72
concept: This composition documents the synchronized extinction of skilled knowledge
  and essential species through the medium of trembling precision. Maria Elena's pesticide-damaged
  hands mirror the erratic flight patterns of the last rusty patched bees - both victims
  of the same neonicotinoid cascade that destroys the delicate motor control required
  for pollination work. The 3/4 waltz time signature reflects the unsteady rhythm
  of trembling hands attempting their grandmother's steady pollination technique,
  while the 72 BPM matches the slowing heartbeat of poisoned systems failing in real
  time. Field recordings capture the absolute silence of dawn without bee song, punctuated
  by the mechanical hum of robotic pollinators. This is not music about extinction
  - this IS extinction's temporal texture, the way knowledge dies in hands, ecosystems
  die in silence, and three generations of accumulated toxins finally claim their
  inheritance. The G minor tonality resonates at the frequency of cellular breakdown,
  while the tremolo effects translate neurological deterioration into sonic decay
  that listeners feel as their own hands begin to shake.
