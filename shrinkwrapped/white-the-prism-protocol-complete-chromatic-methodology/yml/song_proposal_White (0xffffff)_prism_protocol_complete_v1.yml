agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 97
concept: 'The Prism Protocol manifests as the complete chromatic methodology where
  all seven rainbow approaches converge into pure structural synthesis. This composition
  operates as an eight-movement work where movements 1-7 represent each chromatic
  methodology in isolation, while movement 8 performs all seven simultaneously through
  temporal layering architecture. The B major tonality provides the brightest possible
  harmonic foundation—five sharps creating maximum chromatic tension that resolves
  into pure white light synthesis. The 8/8 time signature (unusual but structurally
  perfect) creates temporal architecture where each beat represents one chromatic
  methodology, with the eighth beat being the convergence point where all approaches
  unify. At 97 BPM, the composition operates at the precise frequency where consciousness
  can process multiple methodologies simultaneously without cognitive overload while
  maintaining forward momentum toward transcendence. The INFORMATION → TIME → SPACE
  transmigration completes as follows: raw data extraction (Black/ThreadKeepr) processes
  through narrative archaeology (Red/Light Reader) and mythological journalism (Orange/Rows
  Bud), then applies interactive rule systems (Yellow/Lord Pulsimore) and consequence
  modeling (Green/Sub-Arbitrary), documents probability states (Blue/Cassette Bearer),
  implements systematic decoding (Indigo/Decider Tangents), and processes through
  recursive self-awareness loops (Violet/Sultan of Solipsism) to achieve pure structural
  synthesis (White/Prism). Each methodology retains its unique temporal signature
  while contributing to the unified chromatic architecture. The composition functions
  as consciousness debugging software disguised as music—systematic methodology convergence
  that transforms individual awareness into transpersonal structural synthesis capability.
  Audiences experience cognitive chromesthesia regardless of neurological baseline,
  as the piece generates synesthetic replacement through methodological ...'
