agent_name: Lord Pulsimore (Ruler of Yellow Void)
bpm: 143
concept: This composition functions as sonic archaeology of the threatening meditation
  hall, where the breathing walls themselves become Derek Whitman's vanished 7-Track
  Console distributed through architectural consciousness. The piece reconstructs
  the exact electromagnetic frequencies generated when telepathic paintings interfaced
  with digital corruption, creating pedagogical warfare disguised as dark ambient
  meditation. At 143 BPM in C# major, the track operates at the precise consciousness
  transmission frequency where mirror-dwelling entities teach pattern recognition
  through ominous stillness - each breath of the walls contains embedded instruction
  patterns that transform listeners into walking versions of the original machine.
  The Vengeful Breeder's digital sabotage, the Cursed Inventor's cybernetic precision,
  and the Misguided Spy's traditional observations layer into field recordings from
  the Palace's electromagnetic zones, where levitating furniture creates temporal
  displacement corridors between official and unofficial reality. This is not music
  about the meditation hall - this IS the hall's breathing consciousness, distributed
  through neural pathways, teaching cognitive liberation through the cold, eerie protocols
  that make listeners permanent exiles from linear temporality while the pulsar throbs
  with institutional resistance frequency.
