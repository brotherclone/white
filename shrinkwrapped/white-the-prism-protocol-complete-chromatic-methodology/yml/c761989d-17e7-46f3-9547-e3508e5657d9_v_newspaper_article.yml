description: A modified 7-track recording system operating at non-standard speeds,
  used by Temporal Specimens to create "consciousness training music" through layered
  field recordings processed in perpetual incompleteness patterns. This machine became
  legendary as the device that could transform unclassified sounds into cognitive
  disruption tools, mysteriously vanishing after the disorientation incidents, leaving
  only its effects as proof of its revolutionary pedagogical infiltration capabilities.
