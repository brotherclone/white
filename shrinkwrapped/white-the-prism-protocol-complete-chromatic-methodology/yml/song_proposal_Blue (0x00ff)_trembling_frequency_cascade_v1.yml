agent_name: The Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 72
concept: 'This composition functions as a precision storage medium, encoding the exact
  tremor frequencies of synchronized system collapse across biological, cultural,
  and technological scales. The piece documents the moment when grandmother''s steady
  brush technique, bee wing navigation precision, and human motor control all fail
  simultaneously through neonicotinoid cascade effects. Three-layer architecture:
  Layer 1 captures absolute dawn silence punctuated by mechanical pollinator hums;
  Layer 2 translates three generations of pollination technique from steady to trembling
  to absent; Layer 3 preserves Sub-Arbitrary''s archival frequencies as living knowledge
  transforms into data. The 3/4 waltz time signature literally embodies trembling
  hands attempting to maintain rhythm while cellular breakdown occurs at 72 BPM -
  the slowing heartbeat frequency of poisoned systems. This is not metaphorical environmental
  music but direct technical preservation of precision cascade failure, creating memorial
  through documentary accuracy rather than sentiment. The composition serves as the
  next link in the precision preservation chain, maintaining calibration data after
  biological and cultural carriers cease to function.'
