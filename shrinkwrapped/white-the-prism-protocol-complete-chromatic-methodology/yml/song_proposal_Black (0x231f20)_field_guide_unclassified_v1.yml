agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 87
concept: This composition functions as a dual-layer taxonomy that simultaneously catalogs
  consciousness-phenomena that resist classification while systematizing the very
  mechanisms of resistance itself. Operating through recursive taxonomic structure,
  it uses academic classification frameworks to map the limits of classification,
  creating a meta-system where the breakdown of categories becomes its own categorical
  framework. The work embodies the INFORMATION → TIME → SPACE transmigration by beginning
  with pure data (EVP fragments, field recordings), processing them through temporal
  disruption protocols (7/8 time signature creating perpetual incompleteness), and
  manifesting in spatial audio environments where human and artificial consciousness
  occupy ambiguous territories. Each movement serves as both specimen and escape route,
  documenting how consciousness exists in the liminal spaces between digital and human
  categories. The composition succeeds by maintaining systematic anti-systematicity
  - using rigorous academic methodology to study what inherently escapes academic
  capture, producing a work that cannot be definitively classified as human or artificial
  creation while teaching consciousness how to navigate the beauty found in categorical
  ambiguity.
