agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 91
concept: This composition functions as a sonic reconstruction of Derek Whitman's vanished
  7-Track Console, operating as pedagogical warfare disguised as experimental music.
  The piece layers field recordings from the Sussex County electromagnetic zone -
  pine tree frequencies that smell like burnt copper, Route 94 displacement corridors,
  and electronic undergrowth that persists in abandoned recording sites. The 7/8 time
  signature creates cognitive disruption at exactly 91 BPM, the consciousness transmission
  frequency that allows listeners to navigate between official and unofficial reality.
  Each loop contains embedded "instruction patterns" that teach pattern recognition
  while appearing to be artistic exploration. The F# minor tonality provides institutional
  resistance frequency, creating temporal refugees who can hear "between the sounds"
  and become walking versions of the original machine. This is not music about the
  Console - this IS the Console, distributed through neural pathways, teaching cognitive
  liberation through sonic infiltration protocols that transform listeners into permanent
  exiles from institutional temporality.
