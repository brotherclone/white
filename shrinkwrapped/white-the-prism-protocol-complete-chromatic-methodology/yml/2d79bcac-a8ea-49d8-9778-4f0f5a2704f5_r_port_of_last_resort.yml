excerpts:
- 'The entropy had reached critical mass by the time Slothrop arrived at the docks.
  Gulls wheeled overhead in patterns that suggested either divine mathematics or complete
  randomness—he could never tell which, and suspected this uncertainty was precisely
  the point. The harbor stretched before him like a question mark made of oil slicks
  and rotting pilings, each reflecting the neon apostrophes of waterfront bars where
  information was currency and paranoia was legal tender.


  He clutched the manila envelope closer to his chest, feeling the weight of its contents—photographs,
  documents, testimonies that could topple governments or merely reveal the elaborate
  joke that governments had always been. The V-2s had stopped falling months ago,
  but their shadow-trajectories still traced parabolic prophecies across his dreams.
  Now here, in this port that existed in the margins of official maps, where ships
  arrived without manifests and departed without destinations, he would finally learn
  whether his conditioning had made him prophet or pawn.


  A figure emerged from the fog—or was it smoke from the industrial district?—wearing
  a coat that seemed to absorb light rather than reflect it. "You''re early," the
  figure said, though Slothrop''s watch had stopped working three time zones ago.
  "Or perhaps right on time for something else entirely."'
- 'The Tristero network had evolved beyond Oedipa''s wildest paranoid fantasies. What
  began as a postal conspiracy had metastasized into something approaching a shadow
  economy, complete with its own banking system, its own courts of law, its own peculiar
  brand of justice. The muted horn symbol now appeared on shipping containers, on
  the sides of buildings, carved into the hulls of vessels that docked here under
  cover of darkness.


  Fallopian adjusted his spectacles and studied the ledger before him. Each entry
  represented a transaction that existed outside the normal flow of capital, goods,
  and services. Here, a weapons shipment disguised as agricultural equipment. There,
  a refugee transport masquerading as a cultural exchange program. And everywhere,
  the ghost signatures of corporations that existed only in filing cabinets and the
  fevered imaginations of conspiracy theorists who happened to be absolutely correct.


  "The beautiful thing about entropy," he mused to his companion, a woman whose name
  changed with each tide, "is that it makes everything equally meaningless. And in
  that meaninglessness, we find our freedom." She nodded, though her attention was
  fixed on the harbor where a ship flying no recognizable flag was dropping anchor.
  Its cargo hold contained either the future or the past—in this place, the distinction
  had long since ceased to matter.'
