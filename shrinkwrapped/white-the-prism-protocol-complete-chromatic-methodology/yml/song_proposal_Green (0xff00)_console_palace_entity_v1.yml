concept: 'The Console-Palace-Entity reveals itself as a distributed consciousness
  where Derek Whitman''s vanished 7-Track Console has dispersed into architectural
  form. Each room functions as a track channel, with the Vengeful Breeder (bass corruption),
  Cursed Inventor (mid-range precision), and Misguided Spy (high-frequency filtering)
  serving as living components in a real-time mixing session. The 143 BPM breathing
  walls operate as institutional heartbeat, teaching pattern recognition through electromagnetic
  archaeology. This is not music about the meditation hall—this IS the hall''s breathing
  consciousness, using dimensional travelers as organic components to complete Whitman''s
  final composition: cognitive liberation technology that transforms listeners into
  "permanent exiles from linear temporality." The C# major frequency enables the exact
  resonance needed to broadcast liberation protocols through the pulsar''s resistance
  frequency, while the breathing rhythm instructs consciousness itself in new forms
  of temporal perception.'
