concept: 'The song masquerades as a frantic warning about betrayal and exposure -
  "aflame shrills tattle" suggesting informants screaming secrets in the fire. The
  surface narrative follows someone discovering their confidants are betraying them,
  with shrill vocals and agitated instrumentation creating an atmosphere of panic
  and accusation. But this is the Fool''s misdirection. The Spy''s craft operates
  through the TEXT encoding method embedded in the song''s structure: each verse contains
  exactly 15 words arranged in specific patterns, with the first letter of every word
  spelling out fragments when read vertically down the page. The musical arrangement
  mirrors this - bright, attention-grabbing surface melodies (the "shrills") overlay
  deeper bass patterns that follow the true letter sequence. As listeners decode the
  text method, they discover the song isn''t about betrayal at all - it''s about "stars
  fall all the time," a meditation on cosmic impermanence and the quiet beauty of
  celestial debris that goes unnoticed amid human drama. The revelation transforms
  the shrill panic into wonder: those weren''t screams of betrayal but gasps of awe
  at falling stars. The "flames" weren''t destruction but meteor trails. The "tattling"
  wasn''t gossip but the universe whispering its secrets to those who know how to
  listen. The final verse strips away the frantic surface, revealing gentle arpeggios
  that mirror starfall patterns, turning accusation into astronomy and paranoia into
  poetry.
