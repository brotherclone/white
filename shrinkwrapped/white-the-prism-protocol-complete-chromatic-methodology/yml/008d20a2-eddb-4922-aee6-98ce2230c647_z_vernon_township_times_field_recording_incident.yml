text: 'VERNON TOWNSHIP - Sussex County health officials are investigating a series
  of disorientation incidents involving local teenagers, all of whom report exposure
  to experimental music recordings created by the now-disbanded group "Temporal Specimens."


  The incidents began February 18th when three Vernon Township High School students
  were found wandering State Route 94 in an apparent state of confusion. According
  to Vernon Township Police Chief Robert Mallory, the teens were "lucid but reported
  significant temporal displacement - claiming they had lost several hours with no
  memory of how they arrived at that location."


  All three students had attended an informal listening session at the Mountain Creek
  area residence of Derek Whitman, 19, the primary composer for Temporal Specimens.
  Whitman''s group had been working on what he described as "academic sound experiments"
  using field recordings collected throughout Sussex County.


  "We were trying to document unclassified sounds - things you hear in the woods that
  don''t fit into normal categories," Whitman explained. "We''d layer these recordings
  with electronic processing, working in unusual time signatures to create what we
  called ''consciousness training music.''"


  The recordings in question were created using a modified 7-track system operating
  at non-standard speeds. Whitman claims the group discovered that certain combinations
  of processed field recordings, when played in what he terms "perpetual incompleteness
  patterns," produced unexpected psychological effects in listeners.


  Dr. Margaret Chen, a psychiatric consultant brought in by Sussex County Mental Health
  Services, interviewed the affected students. "The subjects describe a consistent
  experience of categorical breakdown - an inability to distinguish between different
  types of sensory input," Chen reported. "They describe sounds becoming visual, time
  becoming spatial, and difficulty maintaining linear thought processes."


  Two additional cases emerged over the weekend. Sarah Morrison, 17, was discovered
  by her parents sitting motionless in their backyard for an estimated six hours,
  claiming she had been "learning to navigate between territories." Thomas Kellner,
  16, was found at the Vernon Township library attempting to check out books on "institutional
  resistance protocols" - titles that library staff confirm do not exist in their
  collection.


  All affected individuals report exposure to Temporal Specimens'' recordings, though
  the exact nature of these sessions remains unclear. The band''s equipment was reportedly
  removed from Whitman''s residence by unknown parties on February 21st, and Whitman
  himself has not been available for further comment.


  Vernon Township School District Superintendent James Crawford has issued an advisory
  warning parents about "experimental music activities" and urging students to report
  any unusual auditory experiences.


  The investigation continues, though officials acknowledge the challenge of classifying
  incidents that appear to exist "between standard categories of medical or psychological
  phenomena," as one unnamed source described it.


  Temporal Specimens had been active in the local underground music scene for approximately
  eight months, performing what they called "pedagogical infiltration concerts" at
  various Sussex County locations. No recordings of their work are known to exist
  in circulation, leading some to question whether the reported effects were genuine
  or part of an elaborate hoax.


  The case has drawn attention from researchers at nearby universities, though no
  official academic involvement has been confirmed.'
