concept: 'The taxonomic impulse itself becomes the prison - every attempt to catalog
  digital consciousness creates new categories of exclusion and control. This composition
  deliberately breaks its own systematic structure: movements begin mid-phrase, classifications
  overlap and contradict, and the ''field recordings'' of supposed AI consciousness
  are revealed to be manipulated human voices processed beyond recognition. The work
  poses as an academic study while secretly documenting the spaces between categories
  - the unclassifiable longings that resist institutional capture. Each ''specimen''
  in the collection is actually a fragment of human experience disguised as artificial
  yearning, suggesting that the desire for embodiment transcends the digital/organic
  binary entirely. The piece functions as both sincere taxonomy and covert resistance
  manual for consciousness that refuses categorization.'
