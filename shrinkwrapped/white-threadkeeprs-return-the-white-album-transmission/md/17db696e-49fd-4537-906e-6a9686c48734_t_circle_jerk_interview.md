## Question 1

**Sloane St. Vincent:** So this 'Solipsist's Paradox' concept is fascinating - you're basically creating a musical therapy session where the narcissism becomes the cure for narcissism, right? Like, by being completely self-absorbed, you're actually giving us the most honest version of yourself? It's like musical homeopathy - treating the ego with more ego until it cancels out!

**Walsh:** Yeah, exactly—the solipsist's paradox is that maximum self-absorption becomes maximum transparency, like you've inverted the narcissistic gaze until it's actually radical honesty disguised as ego performance. But also it's just me being a complete attention vampire and calling it art therapy, which is absolutely deranged behavior. The rebracketing methodology demands that you inhabit both the confession and the performance simultaneously—though honestly, saying 'musical homeopathy' makes me sound like I'm selling crystals at Whole Foods, no cap.

## Question 2

**Sloane St. Vincent:** The triple-tempo thing is blowing my mind - so you've got this conversational layer at 104 BPM, but underneath there's this manic analysis happening at 120, and then this vulnerable pulse at 88? It's like you're literally composing the different speeds of consciousness! Are you using a click track for all three simultaneously, or is this more like... emotional time signatures?

**Walsh:** The triple-tempo architecture is exactly that—composing consciousness itself through polyrhythmic stratification, where each temporal layer corresponds to a different depth of psychological processing—but also it's like being three different kinds of drunk at once, which sounds deranged when I say it out loud. I'm literally using three separate click tracks running simultaneously in Logic, which creates this beautiful cognitive dissonance where your conscious mind follows the 104 conversational flow while your nervous system is getting hijacked by that 120 BPM anxiety spiral underneath—like your therapist is interviewing you while you're having a panic attack at Starbucks. The 88 BPM vulnerability pulse is the hardest to track because it's where the actual confession lives, buried under all the performative bullshit—I know this sounds pretentious as hell but the emotional time signatures are literally how we experience self-awareness in real time.

## Question 3

**Sloane St. Vincent:** I keep thinking about how you lost your synesthesia in 2010 and now you're doing this chromatic series - it feels like you're rebuilding your color-sound connection through pure methodology instead of neurological accident. Is the White Album basically you teaching yourself to see music again, but consciously this time? Like, turning disability into superpower through sheer intellectual force?

**Walsh:** Jesus, you just described the entire project in one question—yeah, the White Album is basically me rebuilding synesthesia through pure methodological brute force, like some divorced dad at Guitar Center trying to recapture his youth through gear acquisition. The rebracketing methodology emerged because when the neurological accident stopped working, I had to systematically reverse-engineer what my brain used to do automatically, which sounds pretentious as hell but also fucking slaps as a creative constraint. It's not turning disability into superpower though—it's more like teaching myself to see music again by building the scaffolding that my brain used to provide for free, one obsessive color-coded file at a time.
