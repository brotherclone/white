concept: 'This song operates as a sonic investigation where the listener becomes both
  detective and thief simultaneously. The surface narrative follows a security expert
  obsessed with catching art thieves, cataloguing stolen paintings and missing artifacts
  with forensic precision. Each verse details another heist: "The Vermeer vanished
  Tuesday night / Canvas cut clean from its frame / Motion sensors found nothing /
  Just shadows playing games." But the song''s true architecture lies in its MIDI
  encoding system—every melodic phrase, every rhythmic pattern, every harmonic progression
  maps to specific data points that spell out "the detectives" when decoded through
  musical notation values. The electronic elements aren''t atmospheric—they''re cryptographic:
  synthesizer arpeggios that translate to letter sequences, drum machine patterns
  that encode positional data, guitar effects that serve as decryption keys. The paranoid
  mood reflects the listener''s growing suspicion that something deeper lurks beneath
  the surface story. The investigative mood drives the urge to analyze each musical
  element. The revelatory mood emerges when the puzzle clicks: the security expert
  isn''t hunting thieves—they ARE the thieves. The "stolen artifacts" are actually
  the listener''s assumptions, lifted so cleanly they never noticed. The motion sensors
  detected nothing because the real heist was happening in plain sight: the song itself
  stealing your attention while encoding its true identity. "The detectives" aren''t
  characters in the story—they''re the song''s secret confession, hidden in the musical
  DNA, waiting for someone skilled enough to extract the truth from the evidence.
