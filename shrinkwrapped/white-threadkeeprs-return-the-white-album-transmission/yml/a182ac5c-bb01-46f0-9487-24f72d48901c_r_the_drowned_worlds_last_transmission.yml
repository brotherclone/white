excerpts:
- 'The water had risen thirty-seven feet since the morning broadcast. I watched it
  through the cracked periscope lens, counting the submerged street signs like rosary
  beads. Madison. Monroe. Jefferson. The old democracy drowning one president at a
  time.


  My transmission equipment hummed in the corner of what used to be the forty-second
  floor of the Meridian Building. Now it was sea level, give or take a few inches
  depending on the tide. The generator wheezed like an old man''s lungs, burning the
  last of the diesel I''d salvaged from the pharmacy below.


  Static filled my headphones. Then a voice, faint as a prayer:


  "This is Station KQED-7, San Francisco. Day 1,247 since the waters rose. Is anyone
  out there?"


  I keyed the microphone. My voice cracked from disuse.


  "This is Thomas Thompson, Chicago Emergency Broadcast. Population: one."


  The silence that followed lasted seventeen seconds. I counted them.'
- 'The woman''s voice came back stronger this time, cutting through the atmospheric
  interference like a lighthouse beam through fog.


  "Thompson? Jesus Christ, we thought Chicago was completely dark. How long have you
  been alone up there?"


  I looked at the tally marks scratched into the concrete wall beside my cot. Neat
  rows of five, then chaos as my mind began to fray. After day 400, I''d stopped counting
  altogether.


  "Long enough to forget the taste of bread," I said. "Long enough to name all the
  fish swimming past my window."


  She laughed, but it sounded like crying. "We''ve got twelve people here in the Sutro
  Tower. Maybe thirteen if Rodriguez makes it through the night. His lung infection
  isn''t responding to the antibiotics."


  I pressed my forehead against the cool metal of the radio housing. Twelve people.
  In the early days, that would have seemed like nothing. Now it sounded like a metropolis.


  "Tell me about the sky out there," I said. "I haven''t seen blue in three weeks."'
