bpm: 72
concept: 'This composition manifests as a memorial to parallel extinctions - the Baiji
  dolphin''s twenty-million-year navigation mastery and Chen Meiling''s fifteen-generation
  river knowledge, both silenced by the same industrial cacophony. The 72 BPM pulse
  echoes a resting heartbeat, the tempo of memory rather than urgency. The piece operates
  in three temporal layers: the Deep Past (drone foundations representing twenty million
  years of echolocation refinement), the Cultural Past (melodic fragments of traditional
  river songs passed through generations), and the Silent Present (field recordings
  of automated shipping, GPS coordinates, concrete construction - the efficient sounds
  that replaced both biological and cultural navigation). G minor serves as the tonal
  center for grief, while sparse melodic phrases emerge like Chen''s jade carving
  - beautiful objects that speak to no one who remembers their language. The composition
  captures the specific tragedy of expertise rendered obsolete not by malice but by
  progress: the Baiji''s sonar drowned in engine noise, Chen''s traditional calls
  made inaudible by construction din. Each musical element represents something that
  once guided safe passage but now exists only as memory. Silence becomes the dominant
  instrument - not empty space but the profound quiet where songs used to be. The
  jade dolphin motif appears as crystalline bell tones that fade into industrial drone,
  warm carved knowledge cooling into algorithmic efficiency. This is TIME collapsing
  into INFORMATION - the moment when lived wisdom becomes mere data, when the river''s
  voice becomes satellite coordinates, when the last navigator touches her grandmother''s
  carving and finds it has nothing left to say. The piece asks: what music remains
  when the songs that once guided us home are no longer needed? The answer is this
  lament - not for what was lost, but for what was forgotten while we weren''t listening."'
