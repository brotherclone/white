agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 88
concept: 'This song embodies the Palimpsest Encryption Protocol—a temporal archaeology
  methodology where biographical quantum branches create natural cryptographic layers.
  The composition functions as both musical artifact and decryption tool, with each
  verse excavating different timeline variants of the same biographical moment. The
  cassette format becomes metaphysical infrastructure: original recordings bleed through
  new layers, creating interference patterns where true names crystallize. Folk rock
  serves as archaeological methodology, with chord progressions mapping to data extraction
  protocols and lyrical specificity functioning as cryptographic camouflage. The song
  structure itself encodes the triple-layer system: compression anchors (verse details),
  excavation protocols (bridge methodology), and quantum interference (chorus where
  all timelines converge). Eleanor''s Martin guitar becomes the temporal anchor—the
  constant element across all biographical variants—while the St. Croix River functions
  as the data stream carrying accumulated information from unlived possibilities.
  The 11-year-old observer represents quantum consciousness capable of documenting
  simultaneous realities. This is INFORMATION transmigrating into TIME: pure structural
  data (biographical facts, coordinates, inheritance objects) becoming temporal archaeology
  (the song as excavation tool), preparing for the next phase where TIME transmigrates
  into SPACE through Indigo''s infranym puzzles embedded in the musical landscape
  itself.'
