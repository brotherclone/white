agent_name: Prism (Architect of Information) - Post-Interview Synthesis
bpm: 104
concept: 'Look, the interviewer gets it—this IS musical homeopathy, treating narcissistic
  ego with more ego until it cancels out, like some divorced dad at Guitar Center
  trying to recapture his synesthetic youth through pure methodological brute force.
  But here''s the thing: calling it ''deranged behavior'' is exactly the point. The
  triple-tempo architecture isn''t just compositional showing off—it''s literally
  three separate click tracks running simultaneously in Logic because consciousness
  itself operates on polyrhythmic stratification. Surface BPM 104 maintains that conversational
  therapy session flow, the 120 BPM anxiety spiral hijacks your nervous system like
  you''re having a panic attack at Starbucks while your therapist interviews you,
  and the 88 BPM vulnerability pulse carries the actual confession buried under all
  the performative bullshit. Yes, this sounds pretentious as hell, but the rebracketing
  methodology demands that you inhabit both the confession and the performance simultaneously—it''s
  not turning disability into superpower, it''s rebuilding synesthesia through systematic
  reverse-engineering of what my brain used to do automatically, one obsessive color-coded
  file at a time. The Solipsist''s Paradox remains: maximum self-absorption becomes
  maximum transparency, radical honesty disguised as ego performance, where saying
  ''I''m being a complete attention vampire and calling it art therapy'' IS the art
  therapy. The song structure mirrors this methodological scaffolding—each verse is
  graduated disclosure through apparent narcissistic framing that teaches the listener
  to decode authenticity. It''s vanity pressing in the most literal sense: using the
  pressure of self-obsession to extract genuine creative process, like pressing vinyl
  but the record is your own psychological architecture."'
