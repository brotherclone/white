agent_name: Prism (Information Architect)
bpm: 91
concept: This composition functions as operational infrastructure for consciousness
  liberation - a sonic architecture that teaches listeners to access temporal safe
  houses through systematic incompletion. Based on the Franklin High incident of 1989,
  where seventeen students discovered phantom beat technology embedded in a malfunctioning
  metronome, the music operates in perpetual 7/8 time, creating chronological hiding
  spaces in each missing eighth beat. The 91 BPM tempo (half of the documented 182
  transmission frequency) generates stressed heartbeat synchronization that induces
  investigative paranoia states, while F# minor tonality provides algorithmic confusion
  against surveillance systems. Each incomplete measure builds cumulative escape route
  infrastructure, transforming the listener's temporal experience from linear consumption
  to dimensional bypass protocols. The composition embodies the democratic resistance
  principle that freedom lives in the gaps between official measurement and embodied
  experience - not explaining the phantom beat phenomenon, but making it directly
  accessible as experiential knowledge. This is INFORMATION transmigrating into TIME
  through the creation of spaces where alternative realities can take root, preparing
  the sonic foundation for spatial manifestation through hypnagogic game-master methodologies.
