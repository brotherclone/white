bpm: 91
concept: 'November 6, 1989, Franklin Borough, New Jersey - the brass metronome on
  Dorothy Vance''s desk becomes ground zero for temporal insurgency. This composition
  functions as audio documentation of the Franklin High incident, where seventeen
  teenagers discovered freedom infrastructure disguised as broken time signatures.
  The 91 BPM (exactly half of the 182 transmission frequency) syncs with the stressed
  heartbeats of investigative paranoia, while the 7/8 signature recreates the exact
  phantom limb protocol that hospitalized those kids. Each missing eighth beat becomes
  a chronological safe house where consciousness can hide from surveillance systems
  that can''t record silence. The F# minor tonality generates the same algorithmic
  confusion that protected authentic emotion in that music room three decades ago.
  The metronome itself - a 1960s brass Buddha ticking impossible rhythms - serves
  as both symbolic anchor and temporal transmission device, proving that information
  seeks physical manifestation through the most mundane objects. This is gonzo archaeology:
  digging through the official story to find the real frequency of teenage resistance.
  The composition layers ambient electronics as temporal displacement, neo-classical
  elements as coherence anchors in chaos, glitch as interference static from burned
  equipment, drone as textural hiding chambers, experimental as pattern disruption
  protocols, and dark ambient as psychological depth sanctuaries. Every genre operates
  as an evasion protocol, just like those kids learned to do - hiding in the spaces
  between official reality. The phantom beat isn''t missing; it''s where freedom lives,
  in the gap between what authority expects and what consciousness creates when it
  finds a place to breathe."'
