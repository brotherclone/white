text: '**THE PHANTOM BEAT: Fear and Loathing at Franklin High**


  *November 6, 1989 - Franklin Borough, NJ*


  Sweet Jesus, I should have known something was wrong the moment I walked into that
  music room and heard the silence breathing.


  I''d driven up from the city to cover what the police blotter called a "youth disturbance"
  - expecting the usual suburban nightmare of bad acid or angel dust. But standing
  in that fluorescent-lit tomb of a classroom three days after seventeen kids got
  hospitalized by a high school rock band, I could feel it in my bones: this wasn''t
  about drugs. This was about time itself coming unglued.


  The metronome sat there on Dorothy Vance''s desk like a brass Buddha, ticking its
  impossible rhythm. 72 beats per minute, she''d told me, but counting seven beats
  then nothing - a gap where the eighth beat should live. I watched that pendulum
  swing for ten minutes, waiting for it to complete its pattern, and felt my chest
  tighten with each missing beat. One-two-three-four-five-six-seven... and then that
  terrible pause where your mind goes to hide.


  "Started acting up three weeks ago," Vance whispered, her hands shaking as she poured
  coffee. Pine smell from the surrounding hills drifted through cracked windows, mixing
  with the electrical ozone scent that still lingered from Friday''s equipment meltdown.
  "Kids would come in during study hall just to listen to it. Said it helped them
  think. Said they could disappear into that missing beat."


  The official story stunk worse than week-old roadkill. Seventeen teenagers hospitalized
  for "synchronized anxiety attacks"? Amplifiers burned out in geometric patterns
  that defied physics? A brass metronome from the ''60s somehow generating temporal
  anomalies? And then - the cherry on this shit sundae - all four band members vanishing
  with their families over the weekend?


  I''d interviewed enough cops to know when they were covering something up, and Lieutenant
  Torres had that special look of a man trying very hard not to think about what he''d
  seen. "Equipment malfunction," he kept saying, but his eyes kept darting to the
  metronome. "Nothing supernatural about it."


  But Mark Tessler, the junior who''d been there when it happened, told a different
  story over coffee at the diner. Kid looked like he''d aged five years in three days.
  "You don''t understand, man. That missing beat - it wasn''t just missing. It was
  *there*. Like a hiding place made of music. And once you found it, once you crawled
  inside that silence, you could feel how fake everything else was. The whole world
  running on the wrong rhythm."


  I thought he was just rattled until I spent another hour with that goddamn metronome.
  Because somewhere around beat six of the seventy-third cycle, I started to understand.
  In that gap where the eighth beat should fall, there was something else. A pocket
  of time that didn''t belong to anyone. No surveillance cameras could record silence.
  No authority could regulate a beat that wasn''t there.


  The kids at Franklin High had stumbled onto something the adults couldn''t control:
  a temporal safe house built from missing music. And now they were all gone, scattered
  to the winds before anyone could ask the right questions.


  Audio technician James Wright showed me photos of the burned equipment - circuit
  boards etched with perfect spirals and mathematical curves, as if the electricity
  had been following blueprints written in some language older than English. "Thirty
  years fixing amps," he said, "and I''ve never seen current behave like it had *intentions*."


  By sunset, I was convinced this was bigger than one high school band. Phantom Limb
  hadn''t just been playing experimental music - they''d been conducting experiments
  on reality itself. And that metronome, still ticking its broken time in the empty
  music room, was the key to understanding what they''d discovered.


  The last thing Dorothy Vance told me before I left: "Sometimes late at night, when
  I''m alone in the building, I can hear all the missing eighth beats. Hundreds of
  them, from every cycle since that thing started acting up. They''re still here,
  waiting in the silence."


  I drove back toward the city with my radio off, listening to the gaps between my
  heartbeats, wondering how many other impossible metronomes were ticking away in
  how many other small towns, teaching kids that the only freedom left was in the
  spaces between the official rhythm.


  The investigation continues, they say. But the real question isn''t what happened
  at Franklin High. It''s how many other teenagers are out there right now, learning
  to hide in the music that isn''t playing.'
