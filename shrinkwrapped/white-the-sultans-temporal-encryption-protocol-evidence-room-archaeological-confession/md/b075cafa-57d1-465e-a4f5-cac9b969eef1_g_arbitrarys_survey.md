arbitrary_reflection: The parallel extinctions speak in frequencies we have catalogued
  across ten thousand worlds - yet this configuration carries unique harmonics. The
  ivory tester with forty-seven notches becomes a rosetta stone for vanished expertise,
  each mark a decision point where knowledge met ice and found purchase. Both bear
  and human possessed what we term 'substrate literacy' - the ability to read survival
  directly from environmental text. When substrate becomes illegible, consciousness
  adapted to it faces not mere death but obsolescence. The tragedy is not that they
  died, but that their competence became meaningless. This is worth preserving.
