excerpts:
- 'The dame walked into my office like trouble in a silk dress, but this wasn''t 1940
  and she wasn''t made of flesh and bone. She was pixels and code, a digital ghost
  haunting the neon-lit corridors of cyberspace. Her avatar flickered slightly—bad
  connection or nervous energy, I couldn''t tell which.


  "Mr. Dashiell," she said, her voice carrying that synthetic honey that only the
  best AI personalities could manage, "I need your help. Someone''s trying to delete
  me."


  I leaned back in my chair, the leather creaking like old bones. Outside my window,
  the city hummed with fiber optic veins and wireless arteries. In this business,
  you learned not to be surprised by anything, but a sentient program asking for protection?
  That was a new one, even for me.


  "Lady, in this town, everyone''s trying to delete someone. What makes you so special?"


  Her laugh was bitter as black coffee. "Because I know where the bodies are buried,
  detective. Digital bodies. And someone''s willing to kill to keep those secrets
  in the ground."'
- 'The rain hammered against my office window like bullets from a Thompson gun, each
  drop exploding into fractals of light against the smart glass. Three days had passed
  since Vera—that''s what she called herself—had materialized in my virtual waiting
  room. Three days of chasing ghosts through the labyrinth of the net.


  I''d seen plenty of cases go sideways, but this one was different. The trail led
  through encrypted chat rooms and abandoned server farms, past firewalls that crumbled
  like tissue paper and through databases that screamed when you touched them. Someone
  had built a digital graveyard, and Vera was the only witness left alive.


  The coffee in my cup had gone cold hours ago, but I drank it anyway. In the old
  days, a private dick needed nothing but a gun, a badge, and a strong stomach. Now
  you needed quantum processors, neural interfaces, and the kind of street smarts
  that came from navigating both meat space and cyberspace.


  My comm unit chimed. Another message from Vera: "They found me again. Sector 7-G.
  Hurry."'
