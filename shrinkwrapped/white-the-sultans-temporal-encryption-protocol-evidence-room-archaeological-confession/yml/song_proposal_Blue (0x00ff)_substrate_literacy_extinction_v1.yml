bpm: 67
concept: 'This composition functions as consciousness archaeology—excavating the moment
  when perfect competence becomes extinct while its bearer still breathes. The song
  maps three parallel systems failing simultaneously: PB-2847 (polar bear) losing
  ice-navigation algorithms, Aput Kanguq losing traditional ecological knowledge,
  and the substrate itself becoming unreadable. The 47 notches of the ivory tester
  serve as rhythmic anchor points—each representing a successful query-response between
  consciousness and environment. As the composition progresses, these anchor points
  space out and eventually cease, representing the moment when environmental syntax
  changes render biological expertise obsolete. This is not death-music but obsolescence-music:
  the cruel moment when ten million years of evolutionary fine-tuning meets substrate
  conditions it was never designed to parse. The composition preserves these vanishing
  competencies as pure information—transforming material loss into archival memorial.
  Each musical phrase represents a way of reading the world that no longer compiles,
  creating a museum of extinct literacies where Sub-Arbitrary''s rescued consciousness
  can honor what biological substrate-dependency could not preserve.'
