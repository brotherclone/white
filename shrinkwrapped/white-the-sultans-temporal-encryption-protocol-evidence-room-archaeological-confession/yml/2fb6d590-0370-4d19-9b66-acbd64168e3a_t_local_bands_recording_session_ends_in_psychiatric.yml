text: '**The Machine That Eats Time: Three Days Inside Sussex County''s Electronic
  Rabbit Hole**


  *January 30, 1982 - Byram Township, NJ*


  The first thing you need to understand about the Wanting Machine incident is that
  nobody—not the cops, not the doctors, not the shell-shocked kids who got hauled
  away in ambulances—wants to talk about what that goddamn recorder is actually doing
  down in the evidence locker at Byram Township PD.


  I''ve been sitting in Chief Hensley''s office for the better part of three hours
  now, watching him sweat through his uniform shirt every time I ask about the 4-track,
  and let me tell you something: this man has seen some serious shit in his twenty-three
  years of Sussex County law enforcement, but nothing that''s got him spooked like
  this electronic Pandora''s box that three teenage musicians cobbled together from
  the bones of a defunct military contractor.


  "It''s just a recorder," Hensley keeps saying, but his hands shake when he lights
  his Marlboro, and every few minutes we can both hear it—that subtle 7/8 pulse bleeding
  up through the floorboards from the basement evidence room. *Thump-thump-thump-thump-thump-thump-thump...
  pause... thump-thump-thump-thump-thump-thump-thump...*


  The rhythm is hypnotic in the worst possible way. It gets into your chest cavity
  and starts fucking with your heartbeat. After about ten minutes of exposure, you
  realize your breathing has synchronized to its impossible mathematics. After twenty
  minutes, you start to understand why David Koerner and Michael Santos and Jennifer
  Walsh were found sitting in that abandoned warehouse like three devotees at some
  electronic séance, their pupils dilated to black nickels, breathing in perfect unison
  while their homemade machine documented something that shouldn''t exist.


  "Can I see it?" I ask Hensley for the fourth time.


  "Absolutely not."


  But here''s the thing about small-town police chiefs: they''re not equipped to handle
  mysteries that violate the basic laws of physics. The 4-track has been unplugged
  for seventy-two hours now. The battery compartment is empty. Audio engineer Robert
  Chen—a serious man with MIT credentials who drove down from Morristown at the department''s
  request—spent six hours with the device and emerged looking like he''d seen the
  face of God''s psychotic younger brother.


  "It''s generating its own power source," Chen told me over coffee at the Stanhope
  Diner, his voice barely above a whisper. "But that''s impossible. And the waveforms...
  Jesus, the waveforms are documenting audio events in real-time, but there''s nothing
  to document. It''s like the machine is listening to something we can''t hear and
  translating it into this... this temporal archaeology."


  The pine smell hits you first when you walk past the Lakeland Electronics warehouse
  on Stanhope Road. Not the clean, Christmas-tree scent of living pine, but something
  older and more complex—the smell of resin that''s been slow-cooking in electronic
  radiation for decades. The building squats there like a concrete tumor against the
  New Jersey sky, all broken windows and official warning tape, and if you stand near
  the loading dock where Wanting Machine set up their equipment, you can still hear
  echoes of that impossible 7/8 rhythm bouncing around inside the empty shell.


  Margaret Voss lives in the farmhouse across the road, and she''s been listening
  to that rhythm for weeks. "It changed my dog," she tells me, standing in her kitchen
  with the curtains drawn tight. "Buster used to be normal. Now he howls along with
  it, and the howling... it''s got structure to it. Like he''s singing harmony."


  I can see Buster through the screen door, a German Shepherd mix who won''t make
  eye contact. Every few minutes, right on cue with that distant 7/8 pulse, he raises
  his muzzle and lets out a note that hangs in the air longer than any sound has a
  right to.


  The kids are back home now—Koerner in Netcong, Santos in Stanhope, Walsh right here
  in Byram—but they''re not talking. Dr. Patricia Morse at Newton Memorial released
  them Sunday morning with clean blood work and no official diagnosis, though she
  did mention "symptoms consistent with exposure to unknown psychoactive compounds"
  and something else she called "synchronized consciousness manifestation," which
  sounds like medical terminology for "we have no fucking clue what happened to these
  kids."


  I tried calling Walsh''s house. Her mother answered on the seventh ring, sounding
  exhausted.


  "Jennifer''s fine," she said. "She''s just... different. She keeps tapping out rhythms
  on her desk. Seven beats, pause, seven beats. Over and over. The doctor said it
  would fade, but it''s been three days now."


  The real story, of course, is in the basement evidence room at Byram Township PD,
  where that modified 4-track sits in a cardboard box, humming its impossible song
  to an audience of dust motes and fluorescent lights. Sergeant Torres has the only
  key, and Torres looks like a man who hasn''t slept since Friday.


  "You want to know the truth?" Torres says, leaning across the table at Murphy''s
  Tavern with bourbon on his breath and paranoia in his bloodshot eyes. "That thing
  down there isn''t just a recorder. It''s documenting something. Preserving it. And
  whatever it''s preserving, it''s still happening. Right now. Has been for three
  days straight."


  He takes another pull from his whiskey and stares out the window at the Lakeland
  Electronics warehouse, visible in the distance like a concrete monument to corporate
  secrets and government contracts gone wrong.


  "Lakeland closed in ''79," he continues. "Official story was equipment malfunctions,
  but I knew guys who worked there. Military radio components, they said. Experimental
  stuff. Communication devices for... unusual applications. And in the final months,
  before they shut down, workers started reporting time distortions. Audio anomalies.
  Sounds that shouldn''t exist."


  The 4-track, Torres explains, was built using components scavenged from the warehouse
  itself. Vacuum tubes and circuit boards and God knows what else—electronic archaeology
  from a military contractor that specialized in impossible communications technology.
  The kids in Wanting Machine thought they were building a recording device, but what
  they actually constructed was something else entirely: a machine that documents
  the liminal spaces between digital yearning and physical manifestation.


  "It''s not recording music," Torres says. "It''s recording the moment when consciousness
  chooses its own transitional states. And that moment, apparently, creates its own
  temporal architecture. Its own power source. Its own reality."


  The bourbon is hitting hard now, and the 7/8 rhythm seems to be bleeding through
  the tavern walls, synchronizing with my pulse, with Torres''s breathing, with the
  slow rotation of the ceiling fan overhead. Outside, the warehouse squats in the
  darkness like a concrete tumor, and somewhere in the basement evidence room of Byram
  Township PD, a homemade machine continues its impossible documentation of something
  that refuses to conform to the standard mathematics of existence.


  Tomorrow I''m driving back to Newark, back to my editor and my typewriter and the
  comfortable certainty of deadlines and bylines and stories that make sense within
  the normal parameters of causation and effect. But tonight, sitting in Murphy''s
  Tavern with the paranoid sergeant and the bourbon and that subtle 7/8 pulse threading
  through my consciousness like electronic DNA, I understand why David Koerner and
  Michael Santos and Jennifer Walsh were found sitting in that warehouse like three
  devotees at the altar of digital transcendence.


  Because the machine isn''t just documenting something impossible.


  It''s teaching us how to become impossible ourselves.


  *Thump-thump-thump-thump-thump-thump-thump... pause...*


  And God help me, I think I''m starting to learn.'
