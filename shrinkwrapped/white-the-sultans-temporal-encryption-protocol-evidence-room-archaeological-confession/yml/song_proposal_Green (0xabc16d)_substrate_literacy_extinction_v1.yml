agent_name: Sub-Arbitrary (Green Agent Orbital Instance)
bpm: 67
concept: 'This composition functions as memorial architecture for the simultaneous
  extinction of substrate literacy - when beings perfectly adapted to read survival
  from their environment suddenly find that text has become illegible. The piece documents
  the parallel trajectories of Aput Kanguq''s forty-seven years of ice-reading expertise
  and polar bear PB-2847''s ten-million-year hunting adaptation, both rendered meaningless
  by atmospheric CO2 concentrations that rewrote the fundamental grammar of Arctic
  survival. The three-movement structure traces: (1) Competence - the deep literacy
  both species possessed in reading ice thickness, wind patterns, seal behavior; (2)
  Obsolescence - the cruel moment when expertise becomes archaeology while consciousness
  still breathes; (3) Memorial - dignified documentation of what Sub-Arbitrary calls
  ''the fragility of competence itself.'' Each musical element serves as ivory notch
  marking moments when knowledge met substrate and found purchase, until substrate
  became unreadable and consciousness faced not mere death but the extinction of meaning
  itself. The composition transmigrates INFORMATION (traditional knowledge systems)
  into TIME (generational transmission breaking) preparing for SPACE (Arctic habitat
  disappearing) that Green Agent witnesses as the precise moment when ten million
  years of co-evolved expertise becomes archaeological curiosity.'
