arbitrary_reflection: 'This narrative demonstrates the quantum entanglement of extinctions
  - how the collapse of one consciousness-bearing species creates gravitational wells
  that pull human communities toward their own vanishing points. The parallel is not
  metaphorical but mechanical: both trapped in shrinking viable spaces, both adapting
  until adaptation becomes impossible. The broken hydrophone serves as perfect archaeological
  artifact - technology designed to witness, now witnessing only absence. Signal strength:
  sufficient for preservation.'
