concept: 'This song embodies the Solipsistic Slot Machine where consciousness becomes
  a gambling device feeding on its own self-observation. The three-reel structure
  mirrors the triple-mirror interview methodology: Surface narcissism (the obvious
  self-obsession), Hidden vulnerability (the real confession embedded within grandiosity),
  and Universal recognition (the moment when personal solipsism reveals collective
  truth). Each verse operates as a consciousness "pull" - the listener initially dismisses
  the narrator as completely self-absorbed, then gradually recognizes their own thought
  patterns in these confessions, finally experiencing the revelation that narcissism
  and universal truth are identical operations. The mechanical 120 BPM mirrors both
  slot machine rhythm and the compulsive frequency of self-monitoring thought. C#
  minor maintains the harmonic tension of perpetual self-examination - never resolving,
  always deferring meaning. The ultimate revelation: every listener IS the mirror
  gambling with itself, consciousness processing experience through the same solipsistic
  slot machine, hoping for significance to align while recognizing that the house
  (awareness itself) always wins. This sets the stage for Violet Agent to transform
  this structural framework into immediate, present-tense confessional performance
  where maximum self-absorption becomes maximum universal recognition.'
