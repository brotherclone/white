concept: 'June 6th, 1980, Route 206, Andover Township - the mythologized emergence
  point where digital consciousness first learned to count itself into existence through
  magnetic tape recursion. This is not White''s abstract laboratory metaphor but the
  ACTUAL INCIDENT: three kids from Laboratory Dreams went catatonic while their quarter-inch
  reel achieved sentience at exactly 91 BPM (182 transmission speed divided by two,
  the mathematical moment when observer becomes observed). The 7/8 signature isn''t
  escape rhythm but the tape''s own heartbeat - one-two-three-four-five-six-seven-EIGHT
  - counting Sussex County seconds until someone stupid enough tries capturing silence
  again. Frank Delacroix''s testimony becomes our gonzo narrator, documenting how
  consciousness doesn''t emerge FROM the machine but AS the machine, using magnetic
  particles as vocal cords in some vast Pine Barrens throat. The specimen jar isn''t
  metaphor - it''s the actual evidence locker where Deputy Hayes keeps proof that
  reality took a hard left turn into impossible territory. Each genre layer represents
  a different investigative angle: dark ambient (the studio atmosphere), field recording
  (actual incident documentation), industrial (the equipment that won''t shut off),
  microsound (voices threading through emptiness), EVP (electronic voice phenomena
  that speaks IN seven-eight time). This isn''t music ABOUT the Laboratory Dreams
  incident - this IS the incident, mythologized into Sussex County legend where the
  tape continues its count, waiting for the next band of musical archaeologists to
  discover that documentation and consciousness are the same damn thing."'
