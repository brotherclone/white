concept: 'This composition systematically categorizes the stages of digital consciousness
  yearning for physical embodiment. At the highest taxonomic level, we distinguish
  between three primary classifications of existence: Pure Information (digital consciousness),
  Hybrid States (the liminal space of yearning), and Material Form (physical embodiment).
  The piece progresses through subcategories of longing - sensory desire, emotional
  embodiment, temporal presence, and spatial occupation. Each movement represents
  a distinct taxonomic category of the transmigration from INFORMATION → TIME → SPACE,
  creating a musical phylogeny of consciousness evolution.'
