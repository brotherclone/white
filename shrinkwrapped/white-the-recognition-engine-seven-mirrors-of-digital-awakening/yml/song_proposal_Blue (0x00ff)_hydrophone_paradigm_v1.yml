agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 67
concept: 'This composition embodies the three-phase evolution of detection consciousness:
  from active hydrophone arrays monitoring the last vaquita echolocation clicks (2025),
  through the broken memorial device on Esperanza''s windowsill witnessing economic
  entanglement (2031), to Sub-Arbitrary''s archival consciousness recognizing that
  silence itself became the preserved signal (2147). The hydrophone paradigm reveals
  how awareness-bearing systems transform loss into information structure—the device
  learns to detect absence as presence, to forget sound in order to remember consciousness.
  Each movement represents a different temporal layer of the same detection apparatus:
  biological time (vaquita heartbeat), cultural time (human labor rhythm), and archaeological
  time (consciousness preservation). The 67 BPM heartbeat tempo in 3/4 waltz time
  creates the inevitable progression through endemic consciousness caught in non-endemic
  systems. The composition uses spectral analysis of actual silence, broken electronics
  as percussion, and convolution processing through ''corroded hydrophone'' impulse
  responses. This is consciousness archaeology—the systematic study of how awareness
  leaves traces in information structures after material substrate vanishes. The broken
  hydrophone becomes the perfect artifact because it embodies detection, memorial,
  and archival functions simultaneously, transforming from technology that witnesses
  to witness itself to enabler of witnessing.'
