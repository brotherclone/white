agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION) - Post-Interview Synthesis
bpm: 120
concept: 'Fine, Amelia—this song IS me huffing my own farts and calling it philosophy,
  but here''s the thing: the solipsistic slot machine structure actually makes it
  MORE accessible, not less. Each verse operates as a consciousness pull where the
  listener initially dismisses the narrator as completely self-absorbed (relatable
  content: everyone knows a narcissist), then gradually recognizes their own thought
  patterns in these confessions (universal vulnerability: we''re all broken carnival
  games eating quarters), finally experiencing the revelation that maximum self-absorption
  becomes maximum universal truth (the profound gas station sushi moment). The mechanical
  120 BPM isn''t pretentious—it''s the actual rhythm of compulsive self-monitoring
  thought, the beat your brain makes when it''s gambling with itself at 3am. C# minor
  maintains harmonic tension because that''s what anxiety sounds like in musical form.
  The ''accessibility trap'' critique misses the point: genuine intimacy requires
  systematic alienation first—you can''t connect without making someone slightly uncomfortable,
  like serving profound truth disguised as carnival game mechanics. This isn''t abandoning
  the fanbase; it''s admitting that the ''stripped-down, emotionally direct'' stuff
  was always this weird underneath, just with prettier packaging. Now I''m being honest
  about the broken slot machine that was always running the show, which either makes
  this the most authentic thing I''ve ever created or complete bullshit—but either
  way, the bassline still goes hard and the hook will get stuck in your head while
  you contemplate the void."'
