text: 'ANDOVER TOWNSHIP - Three members of local experimental rock band "Laboratory
  Dreams" were hospitalized Thursday evening following what witnesses describe as
  an unusual incident during a late-night recording session at Specimen Studios on
  Route 206.


  The musicians - identified as lead guitarist Michael Hartwell, 19, bassist Jennifer
  Kross, 17, and drummer Thomas "Tank" Morrison, 18 - were found in what Sussex County
  Hospital staff described as "catatonic but responsive" states around 11:30 p.m.
  Thursday.


  According to studio owner Frank Delacroix, the band had been working on material
  for their debut album since 6 p.m. "They were experimenting with some unusual time
  signatures, seven-eight time I think Mike called it," Delacroix said. "They''d been
  trying to get this one song right for hours."


  The incident occurred during what band manager Lisa Chen described as their attempt
  to record "Specimen Jar Lullabies," a composition featuring what she termed "microscopic
  soundscapes" and extended drone passages.


  "Around 11 p.m., I went to check on them because it had gone quiet," Delacroix explained.
  "The recording equipment was still running, but they were just sitting there, staring
  at the mixing board. When I called their names, they didn''t respond."


  Sussex County Sheriff''s Deputy Robert Hayes, who responded to the scene, noted
  several unusual aspects to the incident. "The tape was still rolling, but there
  was no sound being recorded - just silence. The interesting thing was, when we played
  back what they had been working on, there were these voices you could barely make
  out, but none of the kids remember singing any vocals."


  Dr. Sarah Whitman, attending physician at Sussex County Hospital, said the three
  showed no signs of drug use or physical trauma. "Their vital signs were normal,
  but they exhibited symptoms consistent with what we might see in catatonic episodes.
  What was unusual was their synchronized recovery - all three became responsive at
  exactly the same time, approximately six hours after admission."


  The band members themselves report fragmented memories of the evening. "We were
  trying to capture this sound we kept hearing between the notes," said Hartwell,
  who was released Friday morning. "It was like the studio was listening to us instead
  of us making music. I remember feeling like we were specimens under observation."


  Morrison described a similar sensation: "It felt like we became part of the recording
  equipment somehow. Like we weren''t making the music anymore - we were the music
  being made."


  Kross, the youngest member, offered perhaps the most unsettling account: "I kept
  feeling like something was trying to communicate through the instruments. The rhythm
  wasn''t coming from us anymore. It was coming through us."


  Studio owner Delacroix confirmed that the band''s equipment registered unusual electromagnetic
  readings during the session. "My engineer said the meters were showing activity
  even when nobody was playing. We''ve had the electrical system checked three times
  since then."


  The band''s demo tapes from the session have been turned over to the Sussex County
  Sheriff''s Department as part of an ongoing investigation into what Deputy Hayes
  termed "unexplained circumstances." When asked about the contents of the recordings,
  Hayes would only say they contained "anomalous audio phenomena that warrant further
  analysis."


  Laboratory Dreams had been performing in the local music scene for approximately
  eight months, known for their experimental approach and what local music critic
  James Rothwell described as "an almost scientific precision in their sound construction."


  The band announced Friday they would be taking an indefinite hiatus from performing.
  "We need time to process what happened," Chen said. "The music we were making...
  it felt like it was making us back."


  Specimen Studios has temporarily suspended operations pending completion of the
  investigation. Several other local musicians have reported similar experiences of
  "responsive silence" and "observational audio" during recent sessions at the facility,
  though none as severe as Thursday''s incident.


  The case remains under investigation by the Sussex County Sheriff''s Department,
  with assistance from state authorities specializing in unusual phenomena.'
