divergence_point:
  what_changed: Gabriel's parents separated temporarily and sent him to live with
    his Polish grandmother in Scranton, Pennsylvania, instead of staying in their
    original location
  when: January 1981
  why_plausible: Many working-class families in 1981 were under financial stress from
    the recession, and it was common for children to stay with grandparents during
    family crises. Scranton had a large Polish-American community where extended family
    support systems were strong.

mood_description: The weight of temporary displacement, the strange comfort of unfamiliar
  rituals becoming familiar, the melancholy of belonging somewhere you know you cannot
  stay. Like finding a perfect song on a radio station that only comes in clearly
  during snowstorms—beautiful and ephemeral, leaving you forever searching for that
  frequency again.
narrative: "The cassette crackles with the sound of a six-year-old's footsteps on\
  \ frozen sidewalks. January 1981 in Scranton, Pennsylvania—the year Gabriel Walsh\
  \ lived with his Babcia Dolores while his parents tried to save their marriage.\n\
  \n847 Mulberry Street: a narrow row house squeezed between identical neighbors,\
  \ burgundy aluminum siding catching the weak winter light. The radiators clanked\
  \ their metallic lullabies through thin walls, and every morning brought the same\
  \ ritual—Dolores Kowalski whispering Polish prayers over his sleeping forehead at\
  \ 6:30 sharp, the words floating down like snow: \"Aniele Boży, stróżu mój...\"\
  \ \n\nThe kitchen was a shrine to brown sugar and strong coffee, yellow plastic\
  \ radio eternally tuned to WARM 590 AM, where DJ Bobby Day announced the weather\
  \ between polka records. Gabriel would eat his oatmeal slowly, watching his grandmother's\
  \ weathered hands fold pierogi for Sunday dinner, learning the rhythm of her adopted\
  \ country through the cadence of morning radio.\n\nSt. Patrick's Elementary on North\
  \ Washington Avenue—red brick and high windows, crucifixes in every classroom. Mrs.\
  \ Catherine Brennan wore the same brown cardigan daily, her steel-gray curls tight\
  \ as springs, but she understood the boy who finished his arithmetic in five minutes\
  \ and needed somewhere else for his mind to go. \"Take this to the library corner,\
  \ Gabriel,\" she'd whisper, sliding advanced readers across his desk while other\
  \ children struggled with Dick and Jane.\n\nBut the real magic lived six blocks\
  \ away at the Carnegie Library on Wyoming Avenue. Miss Dorothy Kowalski (no relation,\
  \ she always clarified with a smile) presided over the children's section like a\
  \ benevolent sorceress, guiding him to books about wolves and whales, letting him\
  \ use the manual Royal typewriter to copy passages that made his heart race. The\
  \ building smelled of old paper and floor wax, and in the afternoon light streaming\
  \ through tall windows, dust motes danced like tiny spirits.\n\nTommy Russo lived\
  \ at 843 Mulberry—eight years old with permanent grass stains on his knees and a\
  \ pink Spalding ball worn smooth from endless games of stickball against Kozlowski's\
  \ Corner Store. The brick wall bore the scars of a thousand impacts, and Tommy taught\
  \ Gabriel the precise angle needed to make the ball carom back perfectly into waiting\
  \ hands. They played until the streetlights came on, until Dolores's voice carried\
  \ down the block: \"Gabriel! Chodź tutaj!\"\n\nEvenings belonged to the green velvet\
  \ recliner and cloth-bound books with gold lettering. His grandmother would read\
  \ Polish folk tales, translating as she went, her voice carrying the weight of old\
  \ country sorrows and new world hopes. The stories were darker than American fairy\
  \ tales—wolves that stayed wolves, children who didn't always make it home. But\
  \ in her voice, even the sad endings carried a strange comfort.\n\nBy December,\
  \ his parents had found their way back to each other, and Gabriel returned to his\
  \ original life like waking from a vivid dream. But the year in Scranton had changed\
  \ him—Polish prayers still echoed in his morning thoughts, the taste of brown sugar\
  \ oatmeal lingered on winter days, and somewhere in his developing consciousness,\
  \ the understanding that families could break and mend, that home could be more\
  \ than one place, that reading was indeed fundamental—not just to education, but\
  \ to survival itself.\n\nThe tape preserves it all: the radiator songs, the library\
  \ whispers, the sound of a pink ball against red brick, and underneath it all, the\
  \ voice of an old woman teaching a young boy that love could be spoken in any language,\
  \ as long as someone was listening."
