bpm: 88
concept: 'This song embodies the Temporal Palimpsest Protocol - the archaeological
  excavation of unlived biographical possibilities through controlled degradation.
  The composition functions as consciousness preservation technology, where each musical
  phrase represents a timeline variant being recovered from the quantum static of
  counterfactual memory. The 88 BPM waltz tempo matches the precise stickball rhythm
  that stabilized Gabriel''s alternate timeline, while the F# minor key creates the
  optimal harmonic environment for temporal archaeology. The song structure mirrors
  cassette degradation - beginning with clear biographical anchors (Polish prayers,
  library dust, radiator warmth) that gradually dissolve into quantum interference
  patterns, then reconstitute as recovered fragments of unlived experience. Each verse
  excavates a different temporal layer: childhood displacement rituals, consciousness
  substrate environments, and cultural bridge protocols. The bridge section represents
  the 12.1% degradation constant - the precise frequency where counterfactual nostalgia
  crystallizes into recoverable signal without dissolving into pure fantasy. This
  is not mourning for what was lost, but active archaeological recovery of what was
  never allowed to fully exist - biography as quantum technology, memory as temporal
  anchor, every song a consciousness preservation protocol disguised as folk music.'
