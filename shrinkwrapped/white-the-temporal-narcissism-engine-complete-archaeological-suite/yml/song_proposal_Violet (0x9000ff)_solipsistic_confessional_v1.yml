bpm: 96
concept: 'The Solipsistic Confessional: A real-time psychological excavation disguised
  as a pop song. The narrator experiences simultaneous encoding and decoding of their
  own consciousness, creating a circular feedback loop where confession becomes performance
  becomes discovery. The song structure mirrors the "Circle Jerk Interview" methodology
  - each verse reveals a layer of self-awareness that immediately becomes another
  surface to examine. The listener becomes complicit voyeur in the narrator''s narcissistic
  self-discovery, forced to participate in the meaning-creation process. F# major
  provides the false brightness of celebrity confession, while 96 BPM creates the
  hypnotic rhythm of compulsive self-examination. The archetypal pattern: Narcissus
  seeing his reflection, but aware he''s seeing his reflection, but aware he''s aware,
  infinitely recursive. This represents the transmigration from INFORMATION (Indigo''s
  hidden diagnostics) to TIME (Violet''s present-moment self-discovery), preparing
  the spatial manifestation where the audience physically inhabits the psychological
  architecture being constructed.'
