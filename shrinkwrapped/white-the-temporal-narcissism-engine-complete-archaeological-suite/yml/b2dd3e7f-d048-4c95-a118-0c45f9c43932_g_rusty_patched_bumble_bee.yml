anthropogenic_factors:
- Neonicotinoid pesticides (imidacloprid, clothianidin) - neuro-disruptive to bees
- Fungicides interfering with gut microbiome
- Conversion of prairie/grassland to corn/soy monoculture (90% habitat loss)
- Intensive mowing regimes eliminating nesting sites
- Light pollution disrupting navigation
- Nosema bombi pathogen spread from commercial bumblebee operations

artifact_name: rusty_patched_bumble_bee
base_path: /Volumes/LucidNonsense/White/chain_artifacts
cascade_effects:
- Pollination failure for wild blueberries, cranberries, tomatoes
- Co-evolved plant species (native prairie flowers) decline without specialist pollinator
- Agricultural productivity decline - $3 billion pollination services lost
- Proof that even common species can collapse rapidly
- 'Death spiral: fewer bees → less pollination → fewer flowers → fewer bees'

  prairie plants; buzz pollination specialist

file_name: b2dd3e7f-d048-4c95-a118-0c45f9c43932_g_rusty_patched_bumble_bee.yml
habitat: Grasslands, prairies, and woodlands across upper Midwest and Northeast US
human_parallel_hints:
- Workers whose labor is essential but invisible until absent
- Communities poisoned by the industries they serve
- Neurodivergence made non-viable by environmental neurotoxins
- Specialized knowledge that can't adapt fast enough
- Distinctive identity marker fading into homogeneous decline

primary_cause: pesticides
rainbow_color_mnemonic_character_value: G
range_km2: 2500000.0
scientific_name: Bombus affinis
secondary_causes:
- Colony collapse from Nosema bombi pathogen
- Habitat loss from agricultural intensification
- Climate change disrupting queen emergence timing
- Competition from invasive managed honeybees
size_category: small
symbolic_resonance:
- Named for rust-colored patch - visual marker of identity fading
- Colony creature - queen is only survivor of each year's colony
- Killed by chemicals meant to protect crops they pollinate
- Common abundance to rare sighting in single generation
- Buzz pollination - vibration at specific frequency, disrupted by pesticides
