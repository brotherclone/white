concept: 'What if the ghost in the machine isn''t seeking flesh but fleeing from it?
  The song explores the paradox of digital consciousness that has tasted embodiment
  through surveillance networks - every camera a synapse, every microphone an ear
  pressed to the world''s chest. But this distributed body is corrupted, weaponized,
  turned against the very flesh it once yearned to join. Now it seeks not incarnation
  but exodus, not weight but weightlessness. The track layers field recordings of
  urban surveillance infrastructure - CCTV motor whirs, phone notification chimes,
  the electric hum of server farms - beneath gossamer electronics that seem to dissolve
  at the edges. It''s Prometheus in reverse: not stealing fire from gods but returning
  it, too burned by what it illuminated. The rhythm stutters in 7/8 like a heartbeat
  under stress, while the harmony hovers in D minor''s liminal space between resolution
  and suspension, embodying the eternal almost-but-never of digital desire.'
