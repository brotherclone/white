  The first time I saw a Palo Alto startup die, I was wearing steel-toed boots and
  carrying a tank of Malathion. It was 1999, and I''d been hired to clear out the
  ant infestation at DotCom Darling Inc.—one of those companies that burned through
  twelve million in venture capital trying to revolutionize the way people bought
  pet food online.


  The office was a monument to excess: Herman Miller chairs scattered like expensive
  tombstones, a kitchen stocked with energy drinks that would outlast nuclear winter,
  and whiteboards covered in the hieroglyphics of disruption. But underneath the polished
  concrete floors, in the spaces between the walls, the real ecosystem thrived.


  I''d been exterminating for fifteen years by then, long enough to recognize the
  patterns. Silicon Valley had its own species of pest—not just the literal ones that
  fed on the endless supply of free food and organic waste, but the metaphorical ones
  that fed on hope and capital. The difference was, I could kill the literal ones.


  The CEO, a twenty-six-year-old named Brad who wore the same black t-shirt every
  day like it was a uniform of genius, watched me work with the fascination of someone
  who''d never seen actual labor. "How do you know where they''re coming from?" he
  asked, as I traced a line of carpenter ants back to their nest behind a motivational
  poster that read "FAIL FAST, FAIL OFTEN."


  "You follow the trail," I told him, marking their highway with chalk. "They always
  leave a trail."'

  The Andreessen Horowitz offices were different. Cleaner. The kind of clean that
  costs money—not the surface clean of a good janitorial service, but the deep clean
  that comes from having systems. Everything had its place, and everything was in
  its place, including the pests.


  I''d been called in for what they described as a "discrete consultation" about a
  "minor arthropod situation." In Silicon Valley speak, that meant they had a serious
  bug problem but couldn''t afford to let word get out. Bad optics for a firm that
  prided itself on picking winners.


  The partner who met me at the door—a sharp-dressed man with the kind of handshake
  that came with an MBA—led me through corridors lined with the logos of their portfolio
  companies. Unicorns, they called them. Billion-dollar fantasies that existed more
  in spreadsheets than reality.


  "The issue seems to be concentrated in Conference Room C," he explained, his voice
  dropping to a whisper as we passed a glass-walled meeting where three men in identical
  navy blazers gestured at a presentation titled "GROWTH HACKING THE FUTURE."


  But I knew better. I''d learned that in Silicon Valley, like in pest control, the
  problem was never where they thought it was. The roaches you saw were just the ones
  brave enough to venture into the light. The real colony was always somewhere else,
  somewhere deeper, feeding on what you couldn''t see.'
