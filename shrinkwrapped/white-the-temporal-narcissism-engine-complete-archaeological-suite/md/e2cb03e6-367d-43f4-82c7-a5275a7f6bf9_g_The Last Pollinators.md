# Rusty patched bumble bee / Maria Elena Vasquez

## Species Arc: Rusty patched bumble bee
Dispassionate documentation of population collapse from abundance to functional extinction through pesticide exposure and neural disruption

## Human Arc: Maria Elena Vasquez
Intimate chronicle of Maria's transformation from agricultural worker to irreplaceable specialist to dying witness, her body mirroring the bees' toxic decline

## Parallel Moments

### 1. Thirteen years before extinction
**Species:** First neonicotinoid applications begin across Midwest agricultural zones. Bombus affinis colonies show 23% navigation errors in laboratory studies.

**Human:** Maria learns hand-pollination from her grandmother, practicing with paintbrushes on backyard tomatoes. Her hands are steady, her movements precise.

*Connection: Both begin their relationship with the chemicals that will define their endings*

### 2. Eight years before extinction
**Species:** Colony collapse accelerates. Queen bees found dead in fields, their neural pathways disrupted by accumulated toxins. Population drops 87%.

**Human:** Maria's beehives die for the third consecutive year. She switches to hand-pollination full-time, the only way to keep the strawberry harvest viable.

*Connection: The transition from natural systems to artificial maintenance, both species and human becoming essential replacements for what was lost*

### 3. Three years before extinction
**Species:** Fewer than 50 individual Bombus affinis remain. Each one works alone, no colony structure, no communication network.

**Human:** Maria is the last hand-pollinator in Salinas Valley. The other workers moved away or found different jobs. She works sixteen-hour days, alone in the rows.

*Connection: Isolation and irreplaceability - both bee and human become singular, essential, and unsustainable*

### 4. Final year
**Species:** The last rusty patched bumble bee is observed on August 15th, 2030, in a Wisconsin prairie remnant. It moves slowly, its flight pattern erratic.

**Human:** Maria's hands shake so badly she can barely hold the paintbrush. Each strawberry takes three times longer to pollinate. The farm manager asks if she needs help.

*Connection: Motor function failure in both species and human - the same neural pathways disrupted by the same chemicals, the same slow-motion collapse*

## Elegiac Quality
The narrative achieves memorial through parallel deterioration - both bee and human become irreplaceable specialists in their own extinction, their deaths not tragic but inevitable, a quiet mathematics of accumulated toxins and essential work. The mourning is in the precision: each hand-pollinated strawberry, each failed navigation, each perfect fruit that costs everything to create.
