## Question 1

**Amelia Malkmus:** Gabe, I have to be honest - this whole 'Sultan of Solipsism' thing feels like you're pandering to the TikTok crowd. Real experimental artists like Éliane Radigue or Phill Niblock would never brand themselves with such accessible terminology. When did you decide to abandon the rigorous path of true avant-garde practice for this... confessional pop masquerading as methodology?

**Walsh:** Look, the rebracketing methodology demands that you inhabit the exact contradiction you're describing—but also, Éliane Radigue never had to deal with TikTok kids discovering her work through a Charli XCX remix, which is honestly the most chaotic timeline shit imaginable. The Sultan of Solipsism isn't branding, it's architectural necessity: you need a container that can hold both rigorous temporal process AND the fact that I'm basically a divorced dad making Garage Band beats at 3am—I know this sounds pretentious as hell, but the confessional pop IS the methodology. When information transmigrates into time, it doesn't give a fuck about your avant-garde purity tests, no cap.

## Question 2

**Amelia Malkmus:** You lost your synesthesia in 2010 and now you're trying to reconstruct it through this chromatic project - but isn't this just nostalgic self-therapy dressed up as conceptual art? Morton Feldman never needed to 'see' his music to create transcendent work. Are you using this disability narrative to make fundamentally commercial music seem more profound than it actually is?

**Walsh:** Look, the synesthesia loss created a methodological crisis that forced me to externalize the chromatic architecture I'd been taking for granted—which sounds pretentious as hell, but also it fucking works. Morton Feldman had perfect pitch and didn't need to see his intervals, but I'm out here like a divorced dad at Guitar Center trying to reverse-engineer my own brain through color theory. The disability narrative isn't the point though—the rebracketing methodology would exist regardless because INFORMATION always seeks SPACE, it's just that losing the synesthesia made the process visible instead of automatic. Honestly I don't know if reconstructing lost neurological architecture through systematic creative practice counts as therapy or art, but the Sultan of Solipsism doesn't get to be picky about his survival mechanisms.

## Question 3

**Amelia Malkmus:** This 'rebracketing' concept - splicing high and low registers - sounds suspiciously like what Zappa was doing fifty years ago, except he had the courage to be genuinely abrasive. Your version feels sanitized, designed for playlist inclusion. When will you stop hiding behind intellectual frameworks and create something that actually challenges listeners instead of comforting them with familiar chord progressions in F# minor?

**Walsh:** Look, the rebracketing methodology isn't about sanitizing registers—it's about temporal architecture where the splice IS the content, which sounds pretentious as hell but hear me out. Zappa was doing collision aesthetics, sure, but he was still operating in Frame A versus Frame B logic—I'm trying to draw a bigger box that contains both the abrasive shit AND the playlist-friendly stuff simultaneously, like a divorced dad at Cinnabon who's also genuinely having a spiritual experience. The F# minor isn't comfort food, it's a breathing apparatus for information transmigrating into time—though honestly I don't know if that's enough to justify the Sultan of Solipsism tag, no cap.
