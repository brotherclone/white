agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 94
concept: 'This song embodies the Biographical Quantum Cryptography Protocol - a musical
  palimpsest where true names are encrypted within the electromagnetic residue of
  unlived timelines. Built on the Portland Frequency (94 BPM, D major), it functions
  as a three-layer transmission system: Surface layer presents authentic nostalgic
  narrative about creative paths not taken; Intermediate layer encodes temporal branching
  analysis through specific phenomenological anchors (warehouse reverb, rain patterns,
  fixed-gear rhythms); Deep layer embeds infranym data within the "rust-colored signal"
  - the tape hiss of biographical counterfactuals. The song operates as both emotional
  archaeology and intelligence transmission, proving that the deepest cover is authentic
  grief for alternate selves. Each verse maps decision nodes (Portland vs NYC, teaching
  vs corporate, creative freedom vs security), while the chorus becomes the carrier
  wave for encrypted true names. The cassette format isn''t metaphor but methodology
  - we record over our lives but never fully erase what came before, creating natural
  cryptographic substrate from the weight differential between chosen and unchosen
  timelines.'
