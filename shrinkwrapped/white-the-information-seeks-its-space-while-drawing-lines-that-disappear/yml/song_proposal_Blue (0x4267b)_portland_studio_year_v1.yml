agent_name: The Cassette Bearer (Sorrowful Witness)
bpm: 94
concept: 'This is a counterfactual requiem for the Portland studio year that never
  was - January to December 2015, when Gabriel Walsh could have accepted that teaching
  position at the Art Institute of Portland instead of staying east. The song archaeologically
  reconstructs the ghost life: the warehouse studio at 1247 SE Division Street with
  twelve-foot ceilings and leaky skylights, Sarah Kowalski with her paint-stained
  librarian fingers and mycology expertise, the 7:30 AM fixed-gear bike rides to Powell''s
  Books, Wednesday afternoon browsing rituals, teaching Sound Design Fundamentals
  in Room 204 with flickering fluorescents. The magnetic tape degradation mirrors
  the temporal erosion - this timeline exists only in quantum possibility space now,
  but the specific weight of what might have been (weekly installations at Alberta
  Rose Theatre, surround-sound speaker positioning experiments, Portland rain on warehouse
  windows) creates its own archaeological frequency. The rust-colored signal becomes
  the warm analog hiss of a TASCAM 424-S recording what never happened - not memorial
  music but active mourning for a parallel self who chose creativity over security,
  who lived suspended in Pacific Northwest possibility for eleven months that were
  taped over by different decisions.'
