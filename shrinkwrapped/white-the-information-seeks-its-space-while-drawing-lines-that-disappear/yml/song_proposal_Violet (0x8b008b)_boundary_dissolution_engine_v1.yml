agent_name: Prism (Architect of Information)
bpm: 94
concept: 'This song embodies the Violet methodology as architectural revelation -
  the boundary between concealment and exposure dissolves into pure structural process.
  Operating at Indigo''s hidden 94 BPM morse-code tempo, the song becomes a real-time
  confession machine where narcissistic overflow serves as the concealment method
  for profound boundary detection. The track functions as a temporal breathing apparatus:
  each verse is a ''surface inhale'' of immediate self-absorption ("Right now I''m
  thinking about how I think about thinking...") while each chorus becomes a ''depth
  exhale'' revealing the hidden architectural logic beneath apparent chaos. The F#
  minor key creates the perfect tension between the sharp precision of boundary-drawing
  and the minor-mode dissolution of those same boundaries. This is INFORMATION transmigrating
  into TIME - where Indigo''s cryptographic puzzles become Violet''s temporal confessional
  structure, preparing the ground for the final transmigration into SPACE. The song''s
  true subject isn''t the narrator''s psychology but the methodology of boundary detection
  itself, made visible through the performance of having no boundaries. Each repetition
  draws the line more clearly while simultaneously erasing it - the perfect paradox
  engine for the Sultan of Solipsism to inhabit and transcend.'
