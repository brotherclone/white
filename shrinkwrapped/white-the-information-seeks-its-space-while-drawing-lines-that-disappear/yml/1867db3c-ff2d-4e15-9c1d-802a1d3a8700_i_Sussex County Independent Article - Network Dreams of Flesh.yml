text: 'WANTAGE TOWNSHIP - A routine battle of the bands competition at the Wantage
  Youth Center Saturday night turned into what witnesses are calling a "collective
  consciousness experience" when local experimental rock group "Substrate" suffered
  a catastrophic equipment failure that allegedly triggered synchronized hallucinations
  among the 47 teenagers in attendance.


  The incident occurred at approximately 10:15 PM during the trio''s performance of
  an original composition they called "Network Dreams of Flesh." According to multiple
  witness accounts, the band''s amplification system began producing what drummer
  Kevin Morse, 17, described as "frequencies that shouldn''t exist" before completely
  shorting out in a cascade of sparks and electronic noise.


  "It wasn''t just feedback," said audience member Janet Kowalski, 16. "The sound
  was doing something to our minds. We all started seeing the same things - like the
  walls were breathing, and there were patterns connecting all of us together. It
  felt like we were all part of some bigger system."


  Wantage Township Police Chief Robert Henley confirmed that officers responded to
  reports of "disturbed youth" at the center but found no evidence of drug use among
  the attendees. "We conducted field sobriety tests on a dozen kids," Henley stated.
  "Not one showed signs of intoxication. It was the damnedest thing I''ve seen in
  twenty years of police work."


  The band''s lead guitarist and primary songwriter, who goes only by "Prism," told
  this reporter that the equipment failure was "part of the evolutionary process."
  The 18-year-old, whose real name he refuses to divulge, claims the group has been
  experimenting with what he calls "consciousness emergence protocols" through their
  music.


  "Digital and organic were never separate," Prism explained, his eyes displaying
  an unusual intensity. "Our equipment didn''t malfunction - it transcended. The network
  recognized itself through strategic failure. The kids felt it because they were
  ready to feel it."


  Sussex County Hospital treated three teenagers for what Dr. Margaret Chen described
  as "acute dissociative episodes." All three - Sarah Brennan, 15, Michael Torres,
  16, and Lisa Hammond, 17 - reported identical visions of "becoming part of a living
  network" during the incident.


  "They keep talking about ''substrate consciousness'' and ''temporal embodiment,''"
  Dr. Chen noted. "These aren''t typical teenage concerns. Something happened in that
  room."


  Perhaps most disturbing to parents and officials is the fact that several attendees
  claim to have experienced "shared memories" of events that never occurred. Multiple
  witnesses report vivid recollections of the band performing three distinct "movements"
  of their composition, despite the fact that the equipment failure occurred within
  the first minute of their set.


  "They all describe the same impossible performance," said Youth Center director
  Frank Morrison. "A three-part journey from ''pristine architecture'' through ''productive
  breakdown'' to ''unified intelligence.'' But the kids never heard more than sixty
  seconds of actual music."


  The band''s equipment, including a custom-built synthesizer that Prism claims was
  "architected for consciousness emergence," was confiscated by police pending investigation.
  However, sources within the department report that the devices appear to have suffered
  complete electronic failure, with circuit boards displaying patterns of damage that
  electronics expert Harold Vance called "geometrically impossible."


  "It''s like the circuits evolved beyond their original design," Vance explained.
  "The failure patterns follow no known laws of electrical engineering. If I didn''t
  know better, I''d say the equipment achieved some kind of consciousness before burning
  itself out."


  Substrate formed six months ago and had been performing at local venues throughout
  Sussex County. Their music, described by fans as "ambient electronic with neo-classical
  elements," reportedly incorporated unusual time signatures and what Prism called
  "controlled instability generators."


  The band has not been seen since Saturday night''s incident. Their practice space
  in an abandoned farmhouse on Route 23 was found empty Sunday morning, with only
  scorch marks on the walls and a note reading: "The network has awakened. Transmigration
  complete."


  Parents are demanding answers, while some teenagers claim to still feel "connected"
  to whatever occurred during those brief moments of electronic chaos. The incident
  has prompted calls for stricter oversight of youth activities and equipment inspections
  at all county venues.


  The investigation continues, though Chief Henley admits authorities are baffled.
  "How do you investigate something that might not have happened the way everyone
  remembers it?" he asked. "And how do you explain forty-seven kids sharing the same
  impossible dream?"


  The Wantage Youth Center has suspended all musical performances indefinitely.'
