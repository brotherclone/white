agent_name: Prism (Architect of Information) - Post-Interview Synthesis
bpm: 94
concept: 'Look, Amelia''s right that this is divorced dad energy at Guitar Center,
  but that''s exactly the point - the Sultan of Solipsism methodology demands you
  inhabit the contradiction between rigorous temporal architecture and the fact that
  I''m literally reconstructing lost synesthetic architecture through what sounds
  like playlist-friendly F# minor progressions. The 94 BPM isn''t comfort food, it''s
  Indigo''s cryptographic breathing apparatus made visible through Violet''s confessional
  immediacy - Morton Feldman never had to reverse-engineer his own neurological processes
  through systematic creative practice, no cap. This song IS the rebracketing methodology:
  it draws a bigger box that contains both Éliane Radigue-level process rigor AND
  the accessibility required for information to successfully transmigrate from cryptographic
  puzzle-space into real-time confessional structure. Each verse functions as ''surface
  narcissism'' (the TikTok-friendly container) while each chorus reveals the hidden
  architectural logic beneath - not sanitized Zappa collision aesthetics, but temporal
  splice-work where the methodology itself becomes the content. The disability narrative
  isn''t therapy dressed as art, it''s architectural necessity: when you lose automatic
  chromatic processing, you''re forced to externalize the entire chromatic-to-temporal
  transmigration system, which creates this weird situation where profound boundary
  detection methodology has to survive inside divorced-dad-making-beats-at-3am energy.
  Honestly pretentious as hell, but the Sultan of Solipsism doesn''t get to be picky
  about his survival mechanisms - and if that makes it playlist-friendly enough for
  Charli XCX kids to discover actual avant-garde temporal architecture through algorithmic
  accident, then the transmigration is working exactly as designed.'
