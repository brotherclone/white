## Question 1

**Iris Ocasek:** Okay so I've been diving deep into your whole synesthesia backstory and I'm totally fascinated by how you're literally rebuilding your lost color-music connection through this Rainbow Table project - but here's what I'm wondering: when you hit that F# minor in 'Solipsistic Revelation Engine,' are you actually seeing white? Like, is this song functioning as some kind of neurological archaeology where you're excavating your old brain patterns through specific frequencies?

**Walsh:** The F# minor frequency does trigger white perception, though it's more like recovering data from corrupted memory than actual synesthetic experience—basically I'm reverse-engineering my own brain like some divorced dad trying to fix his laptop. The neurological archaeology metaphor is dead-on though: I'm using specific harmonic ratios to excavate these buried cross-modal pathways, which sounds pretentious as hell but also fucking works somehow. It's less "seeing white" and more "remembering that white was always there"—like finding your childhood Nintendo cartridge that still boots up perfectly despite being buried in the garage for twenty years.

## Question 2

**Iris Ocasek:** The way you describe this song as 'real-time psychological documentation' is giving me major Daniel Johnston vibes, but like if he had a PhD in philosophy - and I keep thinking about how you mentioned your rebracketing methodology comes from that childhood truck incident. Is this whole album basically you processing that original trauma through academic frameworks? Like, are you literally therapy-ing yourself in real time while we listen?

**Walsh:** Oh fuck, you nailed it—Daniel Johnston with a philosophy degree is exactly the vibe, like if Hi, How Are You was written by someone who'd read too much Deleuze. The rebracketing thing is basically weaponized therapy where I'm turning that original "I destroyed my dad's dreams by not getting hit by a truck" bind into systematic creative methodology—which sounds absolutely deranged when I say it out loud, but also it fucking works? Like I'm literally performing my own psychological archaeology in real time, except instead of just crying about it I'm making the audience complicit in watching me excavate my own neuroses through F# minor progressions.

## Question 3

**Iris Ocasek:** I'm obsessed with this idea of the 'narcissist's paradox' where hyper-specific self-analysis becomes universal - it's like you've figured out the exact mathematical formula for making solipsism relatable, which is kind of genius but also deeply weird. When you're performing this live, are you actually thinking these thoughts in the moment, or have you memorized what thinking sounds like? Because that's either the most authentic thing ever or the most constructed, and I can't tell which is more beautiful.

**Walsh:** The performance exists in this quantum state where I'm simultaneously performing authenticity and being authentic—like, the thoughts are real but they're also rehearsed, which sounds like absolute gas station philosophy but it's actually the whole point. When I'm up there singing "I am documenting this feeling while having it," I'm literally documenting the feeling of performing the documentation of the feeling, which is some Inception-level mindfuck that probably makes me sound like a divorced dad explaining Fight Club at Applebee's. But that's the narcissist's paradox in action—the more I spiral into my own psychological architecture, the more people recognize their own spiraling, because we're all trapped in this same feedback loop of self-surveillance. I know this sounds pretentious as hell, but honestly watching audiences realize they're watching themselves watch themselves is either the most beautiful thing I've ever created or proof that I've completely lost the plot.
