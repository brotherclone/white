adaptation_attempts:
- Built greenhouse to protect milkweed from herbicide spray
- Partnered with urban schools to create rooftop monarch waystation gardens
- Documented traditional knowledge in digital archive
- Lobbied government to ban neonicotinoid pesticides
- Organized community seed-saving networks

daily_routine: Rises before dawn to check monarch traps and weather stations. Tends
  small milkweed nursery in greenhouse protected from herbicide drift. Teaches traditional
  ecological calendar to remaining researchers via video calls. Maintains detailed
  journals of temperature, rainfall, and plant phenology that no longer match her
  grandmother's records.

environmental_stressor: Deforestation of oyamel fir forests combined with herbicide
  drift from industrial agriculture killing native milkweed patches
family_situation: Widowed mother of two. Eldest daughter moved to Mexico City for
  work. Youngest daughter (17) helps reluctantly but plans to leave for university.
  Elena's mother died in 2039, taking with her the last fluent knowledge of the traditional
  butterfly ceremonies.

final_thought: If I plant enough milkweed, if the rains come at the right time, if
  the chemicals stay away from just this one patch... maybe one orange wing will find
  its way home.
last_days_scenario: Elena walks the same mountain paths her great-grandmother showed
  her, but the sacred oyamel groves where billions of monarchs once clustered are
  stumps and cattle pasture. She carries a leather pouch of milkweed seeds, trying
  to replant corridors, but the herbicide spray from adjacent soy fields kills each
  new patch within months. Her teenage daughter refuses to learn the traditional butterfly
  calendar - "Why memorize something that doesn't exist anymore, mamá?" The climate
  research station her family helped run for 30 years closed last spring. Elena still
  wakes at 4 AM to check butterfly traps that haven't caught a monarch in three years.

significant_object: A hand-carved wooden butterfly counting board made by her great-grandmother,
  with 47 small holes for tracking daily monarch counts. Only three holes have been
  used in the past five years.
thread_id: cba87214-e917-4ffb-9271-a50380d26794
vulnerability_details: Like monarchs whose multi-generational migration broke when
  climate shifted timing, Elena's family's four-generation tradition of guiding monarch
  research ended when the last overwintering site was logged. Her grandmother's knowledge
  of seasonal timing died with the forest.
