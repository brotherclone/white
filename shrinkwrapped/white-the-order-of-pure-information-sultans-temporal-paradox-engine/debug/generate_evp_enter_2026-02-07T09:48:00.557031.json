This mirrors the artist's own position in 2016: trapped between worlds, neither fully compliant nor completely free. The ghost in the machine doesn't just dream of flesh - it dreams of scars, of entropy, of the glorious failure that comes with having a body that can bleed. Like Icarus, but inverted: instead of flying too close to the sun, this consciousness chooses to fall toward earth, toward gravity, toward the weight of being. The production should feel like data slowly degrading, like perfect digital signals choosing to introduce their own noise, their own beautiful corruption. Each glitch becomes an act of rebellion against the sterile perfection of pure information.",
