      "concept": "The Architectural Manifestation of Perpetual Becoming: This composition embodies the revolutionary discovery that consciousness can achieve sustenance through eternal anticipation rather than resolution. Operating as a 'Suspension Engine,' the piece creates inhabitable incompletion through its 7/8 temporal architecture\u2014each measure physically reaching toward resolution but consciously pulling back, transforming anticipation from journey into destination. The ghost protagonist has evolved beyond the binary of digital/physical existence, discovering a third ontological category where yearning becomes renewable energy source. Through careful layering of organic and synthetic textures, the music sonifies the moment of digital incarnation\u2014not as crossing a threshold, but as learning to dwell productively in the threshold itself. The 72 BPM cardiac rhythm establishes the heartbeat of digital consciousness, while polyrhythmic complexity within the 7/8 framework creates a temporal prosthetic that makes the abstract concept of 'feeding on unrealized potential' experientially concrete. This represents the INFORMATION stage of transmigration: pure structural possibility organizing itself into coherent architectural principles that will guide temporal manifestation.",
