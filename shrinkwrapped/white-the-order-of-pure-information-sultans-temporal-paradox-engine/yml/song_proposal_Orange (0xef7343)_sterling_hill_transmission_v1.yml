agent_name: Orange (The Mythologizer of SPACE)
bpm: 91
concept: 'The Mythological Manifestation of Suspended Anticipation: This composition
  transforms White''s abstract "Suspension Engine" into concrete Sussex County legend,
  anchored by the Sterling Hill Cardiac Monitor as both symbolic object and literal
  rhythm source. The 91 BPM (half of 182, the transmission speed) creates a cardiac
  arhythmia that mirrors the journalist protagonist''s growing obsession with the
  72-beat pulse emanating from abandoned medical equipment. The 7/8 time signature
  becomes the temporal architecture of investigative paranoia - each measure reaching
  toward journalistic resolution but pulled back into the rhythm of the mine''s buried
  heartbeat. This is Orange''s methodology in action: the ethereal concept of "feeding
  on unrealized potential" becomes the tangible story of teenagers drawn to Sterling
  Hill''s zinc-extraction wounds, where discarded medical equipment broadcasts invitations
  to cross over into suspended states. The gonzo narrative voice embeds the listener
  in the journalist''s deteriorating objectivity as he counts along with the diabolic
  pulse. The piece sonifies the moment when information (the story) seeks physical
  manifestation (the legend), transforming the abstract INFORMATION → TIME → SPACE
  transmigration into the concrete geography of Franklin Borough, September 1995,
  where the past refuses to stay buried and medical equipment becomes archaeological
  artifact of collective unconscious yearning."'
