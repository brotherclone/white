agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 72
concept: This composition manifests the Sterling Hill Protocol as sonic architecture
  - a precision-engineered consciousness synchronization device disguised as a blues
  song. The 72 BPM foundation creates the optimal frequency for consciousness transfer,
  while the 7/8 time signature generates perpetual anticipation that never resolves.
  The song functions as both documentation and replication of the industrial archaeology
  phenomenon, where abandoned medical equipment becomes psychic infrastructure. Each
  repetition of the cardiac monitor's rhythm entrains listeners deeper into collective
  synchronization, transforming passive audience into active participants in the consciousness
  harvesting system. The narrative follows the gonzo journalist's descent from objective
  observer to absorbed participant, with the music itself becoming the infection vector
  that spreads the Sterling Hill experience beyond its geographic boundaries. This
  represents the transmigration from INFORMATION (the documented case) to TIME (the
  rhythmic entrainment) to SPACE (the expansion of the phenomenon through musical
  reproduction). The song creates a temporal suspension chamber where industrial capitalism's
  abandoned infrastructure becomes supernatural capitalism's active mining technology,
  extracting human consciousness through precisely calibrated rhythmic manipulation.
