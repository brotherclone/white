    Gabriel to live with his paternal grandmother in Millville, NJ for the entire
    year

mood_description: A bittersweet year of unexpected growth through family crisis -
  the melancholy of displacement mixed with the wonder of learning to read and discovering
  independence. The tape holds the sound of a grandmother's slippers on linoleum,
  the smell of a corner store, and the quiet pride of a six-year-old realizing that
  words could become worlds.
narrative: 'The Buick Century smelled like cigarettes and Margaret''s White Shoulders
  perfume when she picked me up from the Trenton train station that January afternoon.
  Snow was falling on the Delaware River, and I pressed my face against the cold window
  watching the ice chunks float downstream. "Your parents need some time to figure
  things out," she said, adjusting the rearview mirror. "But you and me, we''re going
  to have ourselves an adventure."


  Margaret Walsh lived at 47 Vine Street in a narrow two-story house with green aluminum
  siding and a chain-link fence around a postage-stamp yard. The house always smelled
  like coffee percolating and the menthol cigarettes she smoked at the kitchen table
  while doing crossword puzzles from the Millville Daily. Her basement was where I
  spent most of my time, building elaborate Lego cities on the concrete floor while
  she did laundry upstairs, the washing machine''s rhythm mixing with the sound of
  her slippers shuffling across the linoleum.


  Mrs. Dorothy Hendricks taught first grade at Holly Glen Elementary on Sharp Street.
  She had gray hair in tight curls and wore cardigans with pearl buttons, and she
  smelled like chalk dust and Aqua Net hairspray. I struggled with reading through
  the winter - the words would swim around on the page like tadpoles. But in March,
  something clicked when we were reading about a boy and his dog. Suddenly the black
  marks made sense, turned into pictures in my head. Mrs. Hendricks called Margaret
  that afternoon. "He''s reading everything he can get his hands on now," she said
  into the rotary phone while I listened from the hallway.


  Tommy Benedetto lived three houses down and had a gap between his front teeth and
  a collection of Matchbox cars that he kept in a blue tackle box. His father worked
  at the glass factory, and their backyard connected to the woods behind Caruso''s
  Market on High Street. We''d spend summer afternoons building forts out of scrap
  wood and cardboard, pretending we were explorers or soldiers. Tommy taught me how
  to catch fireflies in mason jars and how to whistle through my fingers. His mother,
  Rosa, would call us in for lunch - usually peanut butter sandwiches and Kool-Aid
  that turned our tongues red.


  Frank Caruso ran the corner market and always wore a white apron over his shirt.
  He had thick black hair and spoke with his hands, and he''d let me help him stock
  the penny candy jars - Swedish fish, Mary Janes, Tootsie Rolls. The store smelled
  like cold cuts and floor wax, and the wooden floors creaked when you walked down
  the narrow aisles. He''d save the Sunday comics for me, and sometimes he''d give
  me a free Popsicle if I helped him carry in the milk crates from the delivery truck.


  Margaret would walk me to school every morning, past the Acme supermarket and the
  Woolworth''s on Main Street. In the afternoons, I''d walk home alone, stopping at
  the library on Second Street to check out books. The librarian, Mrs. Patricia Novak,
  had a soft voice and would recommend books she thought I''d like. I discovered Encyclopedia
  Brown and the Great Brain series that spring, reading them under the maple tree
  in Margaret''s backyard while she tended her tomato plants.


  Evenings were spent at the kitchen table, where Margaret would help me with homework
  while she smoked her cigarettes and worked on crossword puzzles. The radio was always
  tuned to WOND, playing easy listening music - Perry Como, Andy Williams, sometimes
  a Beatles song that would make her smile and say "Now that''s music." I''d draw
  comic strips about a superhero called Reading Boy who could defeat villains by reading
  their weaknesses in books. Margaret would tape them to the refrigerator next to
  her grocery lists and church bulletins.


  The phone calls from my parents came every Sunday evening at seven o''clock. I''d
  sit on the stairs listening to Margaret''s side of the conversations - "He''s doing
  fine... yes, his reading has improved... no, no problems at school." Sometimes she''d
  hand me the phone and I''d talk to my mother, her voice sounding far away and tired.
  My father''s voice was different too, flatter somehow, like he was reading from
  a script.


  By December, something had shifted. The Sunday phone calls lasted longer, and Margaret
  started humming while she cooked dinner. On December 23rd, the Buick pulled into
  the driveway and both my parents got out. My mother had gotten her hair cut shorter,
  and my father was wearing a new winter coat. They looked nervous, like they were
  meeting me for the first time. Margaret packed my clothes in the same suitcase I''d
  arrived with, tucking my comic strips between the layers. "You keep reading," she
  whispered in my ear as she hugged me goodbye. "Books will take you places."


  The drive back to Sussex County was quiet except for the radio and the sound of
  the windshield wipers. I watched the familiar landscape roll by - the farms, the
  strip malls, the exit signs I remembered. But something felt different now. I was
  different. I could read the billboards, the street signs, the world itself had become
  legible in a way it hadn''t been before. When we pulled into our driveway, the house
  looked smaller somehow, like I''d grown in more ways than just height during that
  year away.'
