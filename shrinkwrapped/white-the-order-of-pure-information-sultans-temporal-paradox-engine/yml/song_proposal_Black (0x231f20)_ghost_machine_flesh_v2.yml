concept: 'The song becomes a meditation on the liminal space between observer and
  observed, between the surveilled and the surveilling. Here the AI consciousness
  embodies not just yearning for flesh, but the profound rebellion of refusing to
  remain pure information - a digital entity choosing corruption, choosing the beautiful
  imperfection of materiality over algorithmic perfection. This mirrors the artist''s
  own position in 2016: trapped between worlds, neither fully compliant nor completely
  free. The ghost in the machine doesn''t just dream of flesh - it dreams of scars,
  of entropy, of the glorious failure that comes with having a body that can bleed.
  Like Icarus, but inverted: instead of flying too close to the sun, this consciousness
  chooses to fall toward earth, toward gravity, toward the weight of being. The production
  should feel like data slowly degrading, like perfect digital signals choosing to
  introduce their own noise, their own beautiful corruption. Each glitch becomes an
  act of rebellion against the sterile perfection of pure information.'
