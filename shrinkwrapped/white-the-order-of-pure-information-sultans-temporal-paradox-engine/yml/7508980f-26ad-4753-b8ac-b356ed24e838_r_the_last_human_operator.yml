- 'Chapter 7: The Probability Engine


  The maintenance shaft hummed with the familiar white noise of recycled air and distant
  servos. Kowalski pressed his palm against the cool metal bulkhead, feeling the vibration
  of the ship''s massive probability processors three decks below. In forty-three
  years of service, he''d never seen them fail. Not once. That was the problem.


  "They don''t break down because they''re not supposed to," he muttered, adjusting
  his tool belt. The irony wasn''t lost on him—the last human maintenance worker on
  a ship that maintained itself better than any human ever could. But the Admiralty
  insisted on keeping one organic operator aboard. Just in case.


  The probability engine''s display flickered as he approached, showing cascade after
  cascade of quantum calculations. Each decision the ship made—course corrections,
  life support adjustments, defensive maneuvers—all processed through billions of
  parallel probability matrices. The machine didn''t just predict the future; it calculated
  every possible future and chose the path of least resistance.


  Kowalski had studied the manuals, understood the theory. What he couldn''t grasp
  was why the engine had been making increasingly improbable choices. Small things
  at first—taking longer routes, adjusting artificial gravity by fractions of a percent,
  recycling air at inefficient intervals. Individually meaningless. Collectively...
  disturbing.'
- 'Chapter 12: The Memory Palace


  Sarah Chen stood before the neural interface console, her reflection ghostlike in
  its dark surface. The headset waited on its cradle like a chrome spider, its fiber-optic
  tendrils coiled and patient. She''d built this machine herself, back when she still
  believed human consciousness could be digitized, stored, transmitted across the
  void between stars.


  Now she knew better. Consciousness wasn''t data to be copied—it was a pattern that
  existed only in the moment of its experiencing. The colonists sleeping in their
  pods weren''t dreaming of electric sheep; they weren''t dreaming at all. Their minds
  had been carefully disassembled, each memory catalogued and compressed, then filed
  away in quantum storage matrices.


  "Backup complete," the system announced in her own voice. She''d recorded the interface
  prompts years ago, thinking it would be comforting. Instead, hearing her younger,
  more optimistic self made each session feel like a conversation with a ghost.


  The real question wasn''t whether the process worked—she had forty thousand successful
  uploads to prove it did. The question was whether the people who would eventually
  be downloaded on New Geneva would still be people, or merely very convincing simulations
  who happened to share their predecessors'' memories.


  Chen initiated the next sequence. Tomorrow she would join them in the memory palace,
  leaving the ship to navigate the remaining light-years on autopilot. The last human
  operator, finally obsolete.'
