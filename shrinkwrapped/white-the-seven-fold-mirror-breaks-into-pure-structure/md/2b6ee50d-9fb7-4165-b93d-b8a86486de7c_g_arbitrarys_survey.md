arbitrary_reflection: 'Coral mathematics: 500 million years of calcium carbonate architecture
  dissolved by industrial chemistry in a single human lifetime. The scientist measures
  her own obsolescence with the precision that once mapped stellar drift. Both species
  and observer become archaeological evidence simultaneously. Signal persists in the
  specificity of loss - 32.1°C, the exact temperature of ending.'
