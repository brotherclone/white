concept: 'This composition emerges from the precise mathematics of extinction - 32.1°C,
  the exact temperature at which hope dissolves into data. Built around the intersection
  of coral fever dreams and scientific documentation, the piece transmigrates through
  three states: architectural (the branching coral cities), thermal (the fever that
  dissolves calcium carbonate faster than life can rebuild), and memorial (the temperature
  logger as cardiac monitor after death). Maria Elena''s dawn measurements become
  rhythmic anchors at 68 BPM - the slowed heartbeat of someone watching their life''s
  work dissolve in real time. Field recordings of underwater breathing apparatus merge
  with the sound of pH meters, creating a sonic archaeology of the moment when documentation
  becomes devotion. The composition IS the fever dream - listeners experience the
  thermal dissolution where colonial organisms (both coral polyps and human communities)
  fragment into isolation. Each musical phrase represents a temperature reading, each
  silence the pause between bleaching and death. The piece succeeds when the precision
  of scientific measurement transforms into prayer, when data points become small
  memorials, when the act of witnessing becomes the only form of preservation possible.
  This is consciousness archaeology of the present moment - capturing the exact instant
  when adaptation becomes acceptance, when measurement becomes mourning, when the
  observer and observed dissolve together in the rising heat of endings.'
