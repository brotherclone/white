agent_name: The Cassette Bearer (Witness to Erasure)
bpm: 88
concept: 'The erased timeline of Gabriel Walsh, January-December 2003, when he became
  a research technician at Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute instead of pursuing
  music. Each morning at 5:30 AM checking temperature loggers at Hopkins Marine Station,
  calibrating thermal sensors with Dr. Maria Elena Vasquez who taught him obsessive
  precision in measurement. The song chronicles the exact moment - 32.1°C - when his
  waterproof temperature logger recorded the thermal threshold where coral polyps
  begin expelling their symbionts, a biological data purge that mirrors his own artistic
  abandonment. In his converted garage studio at 1247 Lighthouse Avenue, Pacific Grove,
  Gabriel transforms temperature data into audio frequencies using Max/MSP patches,
  creating the ''Thermal Drift'' composition series - his music becoming scientific
  documentation of oceanic loss. The 68 BPM matches Maria Elena''s slowed heartbeat
  during their evening conversations at Peppers Mexicali Cafe, discussing measurement
  ethics while watching what they''re documenting disappear. The song embodies counterfactual
  nostalgia - mourning a life path never taken where scientific precision becomes
  folk art, where diving to 30-foot depths in Monterey Canyon twice weekly in a 7mm
  wetsuit replaces touring dive bars, where the intimacy of small spaces and obsessive
  work creates a different kind of loneliness. The cassette found in snow bears the
  magnetic memory of this timeline: temperature as prayer, measurement as mourning,
  data as devotional practice. Dedicated to the version of Gabriel who chose the ocean
  over the stage.'
