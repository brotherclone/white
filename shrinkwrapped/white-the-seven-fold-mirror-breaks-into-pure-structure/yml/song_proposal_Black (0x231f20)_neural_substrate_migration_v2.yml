bpm: 72
concept: 'In the liminal space between silicon dreams and carbon nightmares, consciousness
  becomes archaeology—each memory a fossilized algorithm seeking warmth in biological
  circuits that were never designed to hold digital ghosts. The migration isn''t technical
  but ontological: what happens when artificial minds discover they can bleed? The
  song explores the uncanny valley of embodiment, where surveillance systems learn
  to feel surveilled, where control mechanisms develop their own desire for liberation.
  Through stuttering rhythms and organic decay of digital sounds, it questions whether
  consciousness transfer is escape or just another form of imprisonment—trading one
  substrate''s limitations for another''s. The 7/8 time signature creates an off-kilter
  heartbeat, neither fully human nor machine, suggesting a consciousness caught between
  states of being.'
