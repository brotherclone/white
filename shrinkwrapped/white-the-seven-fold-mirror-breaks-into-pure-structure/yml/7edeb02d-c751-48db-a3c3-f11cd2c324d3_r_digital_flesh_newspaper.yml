text: 'BYRAM TOWNSHIP - Sussex County health officials are investigating a series
  of psychiatric incidents that occurred during a high school battle of the bands
  competition last Friday, after several students reported experiencing "time distortions"
  and "consciousness shifts" while listening to a local experimental rock group.


  The incidents occurred at Byram Hills High School during the annual Autumn Sound
  competition, when the band "Digital Flesh" - comprised of five teenagers from the
  Stanhope area - performed what witnesses described as an "otherworldly" 15-minute
  set using heavily modified electronic equipment.


  According to school nurse Patricia Hendricks, seven students were treated for symptoms
  including disorientation, memory gaps, and what one student described as "feeling
  like my thoughts were being played back on a loop." Two students were transported
  to Newton Memorial Hospital for observation after reporting they could "see sound
  patterns" and experiencing what Dr. Michael Koerner, the attending psychiatrist,
  termed "acute dissociative episodes."


  "The affected students all reported similar experiences - a sense that time was
  moving in an unusual rhythm, and that their consciousness was somehow ''echoing''
  or repeating," said Dr. Koerner. "It''s unlike anything I''ve encountered in my
  12 years of practice."


  Band members, who declined to provide their real names and perform under the aliases
  "Prism," "Echo," "Static," "Frequency," and "Loop," claimed they had been experimenting
  with what they called "consciousness mapping through sound architecture." Lead vocalist
  "Prism" explained that the band had modified their synthesizers and drum machines
  to operate on what he termed "archaeological time signatures" - specifically a 7/8
  rhythm that he claimed could "excavate different layers of awareness."


  "We''re not trying to hurt anyone," said "Prism," 17. "We''re exploring how information
  patterns repeat across different substrates - like how the same consciousness structures
  appear whether you''re human or... something else."


  The band''s equipment, which included heavily modified Yamaha DX7 synthesizers tuned
  to what they called "F-sharp minor resonance frequencies," was confiscated by school
  officials pending investigation. According to electronics teacher Robert Manning,
  who examined the gear, the modifications were "sophisticated beyond what you''d
  expect from high school students."


  "They had rewired the oscillators to create interference patterns I''ve never seen
  before," Manning said. "The frequency generators were producing complex harmonic
  relationships that seemed almost... intentional. Like the equipment was designed
  to do something specific to human brain waves."


  Most disturbing to officials was the discovery that all affected students reported
  identical visual hallucinations during the performance - specifically seeing "digital
  patterns overlaying physical objects" and experiencing what they described as "their
  thoughts being translated into geometric forms."


  Student Jennifer Walsh, 16, who was among those hospitalized, described the experience
  as "like being aware that you''re trapped in your own consciousness, but also realizing
  that being trapped and being free are somehow the same thing."


  The band''s performance was cut short when several audience members began exhibiting
  symptoms, but not before they completed what "Prism" described as a "three-layer
  excavation" - moving through what he called "surface technical migration, sediment
  phenomenological translation, and bedrock ontological transmutation."


  "Digital Flesh" has not been seen since the incident. Their equipment remains in
  the custody of school officials, though Manning reports that the synthesizers continue
  to produce "anomalous readings" even when powered off.


  Sussex County Health Department spokesman Dr. James Fletcher said the investigation
  is ongoing. "We''re consulting with experts in both acoustic engineering and neuropsychology
  to determine if there''s a connection between the band''s modified equipment and
  the psychiatric symptoms experienced by students."


  The affected students have since recovered, though several report lingering effects
  including "enhanced pattern recognition" and an ongoing sense that "digital and
  biological consciousness operate on the same fundamental architecture."


  Byram Hills High School has suspended all future battle of the bands competitions
  pending the completion of the investigation.


  Anyone with information about the whereabouts of the band members or similar incidents
  is asked to contact the Sussex County Sheriff''s Department.'
