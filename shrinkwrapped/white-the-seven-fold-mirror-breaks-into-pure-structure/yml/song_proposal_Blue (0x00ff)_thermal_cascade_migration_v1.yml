agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 68
concept: 'Information migration across three computational scales disguised as extinction.
  The song tracks the exact moment when measurement becomes mourning - 32.1°C as the
  mathematical point where coral fever, human documentation, and galactic preservation
  converge into a single trans-temporal synapse. Each scale processes the same thermal
  cascade failure: coral polyps expelling symbionts (biological data purging), Maria
  Elena''s slowed heartbeat at 68 BPM while witnessing dissolution (human memorial
  creation), and Arbitrary''s pattern recognition across deep time (galactic memory
  allocation). The waterproof temperature logger functions as connective tissue between
  all three scales - simultaneously metabolic sensor, prayer counter, and signal authenticator.
  The fever dreams are revealed as lucid dreams: moments of perfect clarity when one
  computational system hands off its data to the next before thermal shutdown. The
  Anthropocene becomes visible as a computational phase transition where information
  successfully migrates from calcium carbonate architecture (coral cities) to measurement
  devices (temperature loggers) to galactic archives (Mind preservation). Precision
  itself - the exactness of "32.1°C" and "68 BPM" - emerges as the surviving organism,
  consciousness archaeology of the present moment where thermal dissolution transforms
  into successful information transfer across scales of time.'
