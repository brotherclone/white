agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 68
concept: This song embodies the exact moment where measurement becomes mourning—the
  32.1°C threshold where coral polyps expel their symbiotic algae and biographical
  timelines collapse into quantum branches. The track functions as a sonic temperature
  logger, with each musical element calibrated to document systematic erasure. The
  68 BPM matches Maria Elena's slowed heartbeat during loss conversations, creating
  a cardiac rhythm that synchronizes personal dissolution with planetary thermal stress.
  The composition operates as a palimpsest recording—apparent folk melodies layered
  over hidden data streams, where the "bleaching" of certain frequencies reveals the
  encoded names of what disappears. This is INFORMATION crystallizing into temporal
  measurement, preparing its transmigration toward TIME through the architecture of
  obsessive documentation. The song serves as both scientific instrument and emotional
  archaeology, where Gabriel Walsh's quantum biographies become a universal encoding
  system for concealing truth within the systematic observation of loss.
