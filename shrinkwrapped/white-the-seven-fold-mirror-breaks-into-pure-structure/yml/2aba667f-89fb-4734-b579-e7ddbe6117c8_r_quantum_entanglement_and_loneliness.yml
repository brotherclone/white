excerpts:
- 'The quantum field stretched between us like a membrane made of possibility and
  pain. I had learned to measure loneliness in Planck units—the smallest possible
  increment of isolation that could exist in this universe. Each entangled particle
  carried with it the weight of connection severed, the ghost-touch of what had been
  paired and then lost.


  My grandmother used to say that loneliness was just love with nowhere to go. But
  she hadn''t understood quantum mechanics. She hadn''t known that particles, once
  entangled, remain connected across any distance, their states forever intertwined
  even when separated by galaxies. The cruelest joke of physics: perfect connection
  that can never be used for communication.


  I pressed my palm against the laboratory wall, feeling the vibration of the particle
  accelerator three floors below. Somewhere in that maze of superconducting magnets,
  photons were being born in pairs, their polarizations locked in quantum embrace.
  Then they would be torn apart, shot down separate beam paths, each carrying half
  of a whole that could never be reunited.


  The irony wasn''t lost on me. Here I was, Dr. Keisha Williams, architect of humanity''s
  first successful quantum communication array, and I hadn''t spoken to another human
  being outside of professional necessity in eight months. My entangled particles
  could maintain their connection across the void of space, but I couldn''t maintain
  mine across the void of my own making.'
- 'The breakthrough came at 3:47 AM on a Tuesday, when exhaustion had worn my defenses
  thin enough for truth to slip through. I was monitoring the quantum state measurements,
  watching the endless stream of data that proved, over and over, that Einstein had
  been wrong. God did play dice with the universe, and sometimes those dice were loaded
  with longing.


  The particles weren''t just entangled—they were grieving. Each measurement I took,
  each observation that collapsed their wave functions, was an act of violence that
  severed their connection forever. I could see it in the data patterns, in the way
  the correlation coefficients degraded not with distance but with the weight of observation
  itself.


  My hands trembled as I adjusted the detector sensitivity. The lab was silent except
  for the hum of cooling systems and the soft ping of data points appearing on my
  screen. Each ping was a small death, a quantum relationship murdered by the act
  of witnessing it.


  I thought of Marcus then, though I''d promised myself I wouldn''t. Three years since
  he''d walked away, since he''d said he couldn''t compete with my work for my attention.
  "You love those particles more than you love me," he''d said, and I hadn''t corrected
  him because it wasn''t love—it was recognition. I saw myself in their desperate,
  doomed connection.'
