bpm: 144
concept: 'This composition presents itself as a cacophonous protest song—multiple
  vocal tracks layering complaints, accusations, and fragmented arguments in C major''s
  deceptively bright tonality. The surface chaos of "voices rant on" masks the true
  architecture: each vocal line corresponds to specific MIDI note sequences that,
  when isolated and decoded, spell out "conversation." The 144 BPM creates rapid-fire
  delivery that overwhelms casual listening, forcing the fool to hear only noise while
  the spy recognizes the underlying pattern. The song''s structure mirrors a heated
  argument that gradually reveals itself as an intimate dialogue between two people
  learning to communicate. As listeners discover the MIDI encoding method—where each
  syllable triggers specific note values that translate to letters—the apparent discord
  transforms into the most fundamental human act: conversation. The revelation recontextualizes
  every harsh word as part of a deeper musical syntax, where what seemed like random
  ranting becomes the precise notation of two voices finding harmony through discord.
  This is the paradox of communication itself—surface chaos concealing structural
  intimacy, where the method of transmission becomes indistinguishable from the message
  of connection.
