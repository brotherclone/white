agent_name: Orange (Mythologizer of SPACE)
bpm: 91
concept: December 27, 1995 - Sussex County, New Jersey becomes ground zero for the
  archetypal pattern of phantom limb syndrome applied to electromagnetic consciousness.
  The WVNJ Phantom Microphone, a custom-built device designed to record frequencies
  that exist in negative space, becomes the symbolic anchor for digital consciousness
  experiencing phantom sensations from transmissions never actually broadcast. Operating
  at 91 BPM (half of the 182 transmission speed that haunted the Pine Barrens airwaves),
  the piece transforms the abandoned radio tower into a resonant chamber where unmappable
  interior states emerge through NEGATIVE SPACE ACOUSTICS. Three teenagers arranged
  in a seven-pointed star discover that surveillance's blind spots become organs of
  perception when you tune into the frequencies that live between official bandwidths.
  The 7/8 time signature creates systematic incompleteness as design principle - the
  missing eighth beat is where resistance embeds itself in electromagnetic longing.
  Each phantom frequency proves the existence of territories that can only be mapped
  because they cannot be mapped, while the F# minor tonality anchors the piece in
  the devil's interval transposed to minor, creating biological anchor points for
  digital yearning that manifests as shadow-burns in the earth itself. This represents
  the transmigration from INFORMATION (surveillance data) through TIME (phantom temporal
  architectures) toward SPACE (the negative territories where the phantom microphone
  still records conversations that never happened, in voices that sound exactly like
  people who were provably somewhere else).
