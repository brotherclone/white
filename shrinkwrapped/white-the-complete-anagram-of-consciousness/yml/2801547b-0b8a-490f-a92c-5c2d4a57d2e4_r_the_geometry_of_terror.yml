excerpts:
- 'The architectural grammar of fear reveals itself not in the soaring cathedral or
  the intimate dwelling, but in those liminal spaces where human intention collides
  with geometric impossibility. Consider the Pentagon—that five-sided fortress of
  bureaucratic power—where each angle creates a blind spot, each corridor a potential
  trap. The very shape whispers of paranoia made manifest in concrete and steel.


  In my years studying the intersection of spatial design and psychological manipulation,
  I have come to understand that terror is not merely an emotion but a mathematical
  principle. It follows rules as rigid as those governing the golden ratio or the
  Fibonacci sequence. The torturer''s chamber, the prison panopticon, the suburban
  cul-de-sac—each represents a calculated deployment of geometric principles designed
  to induce specific psychological states.


  The triangle, that most stable of forms, becomes unstable when inverted. The circle,
  symbol of wholeness, transforms into the noose when reduced to a loop. Even the
  humble rectangle—foundation of our built environment—can become a coffin when its
  proportions shift beyond the comfortable ratios our minds expect. This is the dark
  mathematics I have spent decades mapping, the shadow geometry that underlies our
  most profound fears.'
- 'The Maze Protocol, as I have termed it, represents perhaps the most sophisticated
  application of geometric terror in recorded history. Discovered in fragments among
  the archived documents of Project ARTICHOKE, these blueprints reveal a systematic
  approach to spatial disorientation that transcends mere confusion to achieve complete
  psychological dissolution.


  The protocol begins with the construction of a seven-sided chamber—the heptagon
  being particularly unsettling to human perception due to its resistance to mental
  subdivision. Within this space, walls are positioned at angles that violate our
  innate understanding of parallel lines. Floors slope imperceptibly, creating a sensation
  of movement even in stillness. Ceilings curve in ways that suggest infinite recession
  while maintaining claustrophobic proximity.


  But the true genius lies not in any single element but in their interaction. The
  subject, placed within this environment, experiences what I have termed "geometric
  gaslighting"—a systematic undermining of their spatial confidence that extends far
  beyond the physical realm. When one can no longer trust the angles of a room, how
  can one trust the angles of thought itself? The maze becomes not just a physical
  trap but an epistemological one, calling into question the very foundations of rational
  perception.'
