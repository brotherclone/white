concept: 'This represents the structural collapse of subject/object boundaries through
  the medium of self-interview—and yes, it''s absolutely therapy music for people
  who think they''re too smart for actual therapy, which is precisely why it works.
  Simon''s right that this is "Stockhausen for people who eat at Applebee''s," but
  that collision IS the content: the rebracketing methodology documents what happens
  when Xenakis meets Post Malone through paper-thin apartment walls, creating the
  only honest condition for contemporary experimental music. The 79 BPM isn''t some
  mystical liminal space—it''s literally the tempo of anxious self-examination, the
  exact speed at which consciousness tries to interview itself while ordering a Cinnabon.
  Building on Indigo''s cryptographic revelation that "every secret is ultimately
  self-referential," the song manifests as a polyrhythmic confession where the interviewer
  and interviewee exist simultaneously in different temporal layers, but also like,
  yeah, it''s divorced dad energy at a meditation retreat, no cap. The F# minor key
  provides the perfect tonal space for introspective revelation while maintaining
  enough harmonic tension to support the recursive questioning structure—the musical
  embodiment of someone who lost their synesthesia in 2010 and is now reverse-engineering
  cross-modal perception through elaborate musical mourning. This is the Sultan''s
  eternal present-tense existence filtered through the pharmaceutical damage that
  revealed the methodology: always in the process of revealing himself to himself
  while his neighbor blasts contemporary hits, creating an infinite loop of self-discovery
  that serves as the bridge between INFORMATION (what I lost) and TIME (what I''m
  building back). The song structure mirrors the anagram principle: each musical phrase
  contains its own answer rearranged, creating a sonic palindrome of consciousness
  examining itself—accessible enough for indie rock kids who discovered experimental
  music through Radiohead inte...'
