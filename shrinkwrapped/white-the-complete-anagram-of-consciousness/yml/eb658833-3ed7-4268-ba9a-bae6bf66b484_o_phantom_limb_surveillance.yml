text: 'WANTAGE TOWNSHIP - Three members of local experimental rock band "Negative
  Space" were hospitalized Tuesday night following what witnesses described as an
  unusual incident during a recording session at an abandoned radio tower facility
  on Clove Road.


  The band, comprised of high school seniors Michael Torres, 17, Jennifer Walsh, 18,
  and David Chen, 17, had been using the decommissioned WVNJ transmission site since
  October to record what they called their "phantom album" - a concept record exploring
  what Torres described as "frequencies that exist in the spaces between other frequencies."


  According to Sussex County Sheriff''s Deputy Robert Krantz, who responded to the
  scene at approximately 11:47 PM, all three band members were found unconscious near
  their equipment, which had been arranged in a precise seven-sided configuration
  around the base of the 200-foot transmission tower.


  "When we arrived, the kids were out cold, but their instruments were still plugged
  in and making this... sound," Krantz said. "It wasn''t music exactly. More like
  a heartbeat, but slower. Real slow. The paramedics said their pulse rates had somehow
  synchronized to match it - 72 beats per minute exactly."


  Jennifer Walsh, who regained consciousness first at Newton Memorial Hospital, told
  investigators that the band had been experimenting with what they called "surveillance
  acoustics" - using the tower''s residual electromagnetic field to create what she
  described as "music from the blind spots."


  "We weren''t trying to hurt anybody," Walsh said from her hospital bed Wednesday.
  "We just wanted to record the sounds that surveillance equipment can''t pick up.
  The frequencies that hide in the gaps."


  Dr. Patricia Vance, the attending physician, noted that all three patients exhibited
  symptoms consistent with acute dissociation, reporting sensations of "phantom limbs"
  - feeling appendages that weren''t there, or conversely, being unable to feel limbs
  that were clearly present.


  "It''s as if their proprioceptive systems had been completely scrambled," Dr. Vance
  explained. "They kept reaching for instruments that weren''t in their hands, or
  trying to play guitar parts with fingers that felt absent to them."


  The most puzzling aspect of the incident involves the band''s equipment. When deputies
  returned to secure the scene Wednesday morning, several key pieces - including a
  custom-built frequency generator Torres had constructed from salvaged radio parts
  and what Walsh described as a "phantom microphone" designed to record "negative
  space acoustics" - had vanished.


  "The weird thing is, we can see the impressions in the dirt where the equipment
  was," Deputy Krantz noted. "Perfect outlines, like shadows burned into the ground.
  But the gear itself? Gone."


  Security footage from a nearby cell tower shows the three band members entering
  the site at approximately 9:15 PM Tuesday, but the recording cuts to static at 10:23
  PM and doesn''t resume until after deputies arrived. The missing 84 minutes of footage
  has telecommunications officials baffled.


  "There''s no technical explanation for that kind of selective data loss," said Verizon
  technician Mark Romano, who examined the surveillance system. "It''s like something
  specifically targeted that timeframe for erasure."


  The abandoned WVNJ facility, which ceased operations in 1982, has been the subject
  of local folklore for years. Area residents have reported unusual electromagnetic
  phenomena, including radio receivers picking up broadcasts from decades past and
  compasses spinning wildly within a quarter-mile radius of the tower.


  Torres, who remains hospitalized with what doctors describe as "phantom frequency
  syndrome," told investigators through a written statement that the band had been
  "mapping territories that can only be found by not looking for them."


  "We found the rhythm that surveillance can''t hear," his statement read. "Seven
  beats where there should be eight. The missing beat is where resistance lives."


  All three band members are expected to make full physical recoveries, though Dr.
  Vance notes that their neurological symptoms may persist. The investigation into
  the missing equipment remains open.


  The Wantage Township Council has voted to install additional security measures around
  the abandoned transmission site, though Councilwoman Ruth Morrison acknowledged
  that traditional surveillance methods may prove ineffective.


  "How do you monitor something that exists specifically in the spaces surveillance
  can''t reach?" Morrison asked during Tuesday''s emergency session. "Maybe some mysteries
  are meant to stay that way."


  The band''s parents have requested privacy during the recovery period. No charges
  are expected to be filed, though the case has been referred to state authorities
  specializing in unexplained electromagnetic phenomena.


  Anyone with information about the missing equipment or the events of Tuesday night
  is asked to contact the Sussex County Sheriff''s Office at (973) 579-0850.'
