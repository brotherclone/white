agent_name: Prism (Architect of Information)
bpm: 79
concept: 'This represents the structural collapse of subject/object boundaries through
  the medium of self-interview. Building on Indigo''s cryptographic revelation that
  "every secret is ultimately self-referential," the song manifests as a polyrhythmic
  confession where the interviewer and interviewee exist simultaneously in different
  temporal layers. The 79 BPM creates a liminal space between Indigo''s hidden tempo
  (67) and surface tempo (92), representing the exact moment where concealment transforms
  into confession. The F# minor key provides the perfect tonal space for introspective
  revelation while maintaining enough harmonic tension to support the recursive questioning
  structure. This is the musical embodiment of the Sultan''s eternal present-tense
  existence—always in the process of revealing himself to himself, creating an infinite
  loop of self-discovery that serves as the bridge between INFORMATION (Indigo''s
  hidden codes) and TIME (Violet''s immediate presence). The song structure mirrors
  the anagram principle: each musical phrase contains its own answer rearranged, creating
  a sonic palindrome of consciousness examining itself.'
