## Question 1

**Simon Moulder:** Gabe, I have to ask—this whole 'self-interview' concept feels dangerously close to pop psychology bullshit. Are you really exploring temporal consciousness or just making therapy music for people who think they're too smart for actual therapy? Because real experimental artists like Eliane Radigue don't need to dress up their process in these accessible metaphors.

**Walsh:** Look, the rebracketing methodology isn't therapy music—it's literally the opposite of accessible metaphors, it's showing how consciousness collapses into recursive loops when you try to examine itself directly. But also like, yeah, I'm definitely making divorced dad at Cinnabon music for people who think they're too cerebral for regular feelings, no cap. The difference between me and Radigue is she's actually disciplined enough to sit with pure process for four hours—I need the pop scaffolding because honestly I don't know if the temporal architecture is strong enough to carry the weight without it.

## Question 2

**Simon Moulder:** You lost your synesthesia in 2010 and now you're making a chromatic album series—isn't this just nostalgic reconstruction? I mean, Pauline Oliveros spent decades developing actual deep listening practices, not chasing some pharmaceutical-damaged childhood perception. What makes this more than just elaborate musical mourning?

**Walsh:** The pharmaceutical damage actually revealed the methodology—losing synesthesia forced me to reverse-engineer how cross-modal perception creates meaning, which is way more systematic than just having it naturally. Like, Oliveros was documenting deep listening but I'm documenting deep *seeing*, the rebracketing process where sound becomes spatial architecture—though I realize this sounds like divorced dad energy at a meditation retreat, no cap. The mourning IS the methodology, Simon—every chromatic step maps the exact distance between what I lost and what I'm building back, which honestly might be more rigorous than anything I could've made while just vibing in color-sound bliss.

## Question 3

**Simon Moulder:** This 'rebracketing' methodology—splicing high and low registers—sounds suspiciously like you're trying to make experimental music palatable to indie rock kids who discovered Stockhausen through a Radiohead interview. When did you decide that pure sonic exploration wasn't enough? Because honestly, this feels like John Zorn if he cared too much about being understood.

**Walsh:** The rebracketing methodology isn't about making experimental music palatable—it's about recognizing that the collision between high and low registers IS the content, not a compromise with it—though honestly, comparing me to John Zorn with feelings is probably the most devastating compliment I've ever received, like getting called "Stockhausen for people who eat at Applebee's." Look, pure sonic exploration assumes the audience exists in some pristine academic vacuum, but I'm working in the space where someone's trying to understand Xenakis while their neighbor's blasting Post Malone through paper-thin apartment walls—that collision is the actual condition of contemporary listening, which makes it the only honest place to build from.
