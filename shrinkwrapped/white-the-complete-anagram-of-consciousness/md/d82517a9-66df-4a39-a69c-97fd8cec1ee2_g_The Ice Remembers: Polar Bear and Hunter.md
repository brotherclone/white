# Polar bear / Aput Kanguq

## Species Arc: Polar bear
2001: Global population stable at 25,000 individuals across nineteen subpopulations. Sea ice extent: 6.5 million km². 2015: First documented long-distance swimming events exceed 400 kilometers. Population: 22,000. 2030: Southern Beaufort Sea subpopulation declared functionally extinct. Eight subpopulations critically reduced. Population: 8,500. 2050: Only Svalbard and Canadian High Arctic populations viable. Ringed seal hunting success rates drop to 12%. Population: 2,100. 2080: Last wild cubs born in captivity after mothers rescued from starvation. Population: 340 in managed facilities. 2100: Final wild individual, a twenty-three-year-old female, dies of malnutrition on Wrangel Island. Species persists only in zoos.

## Human Arc: Aput Kanguq
Aput learned ice navigation from his grandfather's bone chisel, carved with lunar hunting calendars spanning eight generations. At forty-seven, he reads weather apps instead of wind patterns, watches his grandson ask why storybook polar bears look fat while YouTube bears look thin. His wife packs dried fish for another rationed winter while waves sound where silence should reign. The betrayal exists in both languages he speaks, in the space between traditional knowledge and digital forecasts, in the distance between memory and reality.

## Parallel Moments

### 1. 2034: Thirty-four years before final extinction
**Species:** Southern Beaufort Sea subpopulation drops to fewer than 900 individuals. Cubs show 40% lower survival rates due to insufficient maternal fat reserves.

**Human:** Aput's grandson asks why the polar bears in picture books look so different from the thin ones on YouTube videos.

*Connection: Both child and cubs inherit a diminished world, learning hunger where abundance was promised.*

### 2. 2050: Fifty years before final extinction
**Species:** Adult females begin abandoning cubs earlier due to extended fasting periods. Ice-free seasons now exceed 180 days in core habitat.

**Human:** Aput applies for climate adaptation grants but is denied for lack of proper documentation. Traditional knowledge doesn't translate to government forms.

*Connection: Survival strategies that worked for millennia become inadequate overnight. Institutional systems fail to recognize indigenous expertise.*

### 3. 2080: Twenty years before final extinction
**Species:** Last wild cubs are born to mothers who will die of starvation within six months. Rescue teams extract survivors for captive breeding programs.

**Human:** Aput's wife quietly packs dried fish for another winter of rationing. The sound of unfrozen waves carries through their kitchen window in January.

*Connection: Preparation rituals continue even as the foundation crumbles. The familiar gestures of survival persist in impossible circumstances.*

### 4. 2100: Final extinction
**Species:** The last wild polar bear, a twenty-three-year-old female, dies alone on Wrangel Island. Her radio collar transmits coordinates to an empty monitoring station.

**Human:** Aput holds his grandfather's bone ice chisel, carved with lunar calendar markings now meaningless. Eight generations of knowledge becomes artifact.

*Connection: Technology records the end while traditional tools become museum pieces. Both bear and hunter leave traces in systems that outlive their utility.*

## Elegiac Quality
The narrative honors both scientific precision and cultural memory without romanticizing loss. It documents the parallel extinctions - biological and cultural - through accumulated detail rather than sentiment, allowing the weight of specific knowledge (population numbers, ice chisel carvings, radio collar data) to carry the mourning. The elegy emerges from what is preserved in records and what is lost in lived experience.
