divergence_point:
  what_changed: Gabriel's parents, instead of staying in their original location,
    moved to 247 Elm Street in Millfield, Ohio when he was 2 months old due to his
    father getting a job at the Hoover Company vacuum factory
  when: February 1975
  why_plausible: The mid-70s saw many young families relocating for manufacturing
    jobs, and Hoover was actively hiring in North Canton/Millfield area during this
    period

- First year shaped by economic uncertainty and factory layoffs
- Lived in rental house with specific architectural character and quirks
mood_description: The melancholy weight of industrial winter, the particular loneliness
  of young parents far from extended family, tempered by the unexpected warmth of
  neighborhood solidarity. There's a Bruce Springsteen quality to this alternate timeline
  - the dignity of working people, the small kindnesses that sustain community, the
  way economic uncertainty shapes even the most intimate moments of family life. The
  factory whistle becomes a metronome for memory, marking time in a life that could
  have been.
narrative: 'In this timeline, Gabriel Walsh spent his first year not in the hazy suburban
  anonymity of his actual birth, but in the narrow wooden house at 247 Elm Street
  in Millfield, Ohio, where the Hoover vacuum factory smokestacks rose like gray fingers
  against the winter sky.


  His father, Robert Walsh, had taken a job on the assembly line at Hoover in February
  1975, drawn by the promise of union wages and health benefits. The family packed
  their few belongings into a borrowed Chevy pickup and drove through the slush and
  salt of late winter to arrive at the rental house - a two-story frame building with
  peeling white paint and a front porch that sagged slightly toward the street.


  Gabriel''s nursery was the small back bedroom on the second floor, where morning
  light filtered through thin yellow curtains that his mother, Patricia Walsh, had
  sewn from fabric remnants. The room smelled perpetually of Johnson''s baby powder
  and the faint industrial sweetness that drifted from the factory on humid days.
  His crib, a hand-me-down from the previous tenants, sat positioned so he could see
  out the single window to the backyard, where Mrs. Helen Kowalski from next door
  tended her victory garden of tomatoes, green beans, and marigolds.


  The sounds of this alternate first year were different: the 6 AM factory whistle
  that woke the neighborhood, the rhythmic clatter of the Pennsylvania Railroad freight
  trains carrying finished vacuum cleaners east toward Cleveland, and the voices of
  the neighborhood children - the Kowalski twins, Maria and Stefan, playing kickball
  in the street, and little Amy Chen from 251 Elm practicing violin scales that drifted
  through the thin walls.


  Mrs. Dorothy Chen, Amy''s mother, became Patricia''s closest friend during those
  months. She worked the evening shift at the Timken bearing plant and would stop
  by in the afternoons with homemade dumplings and advice about raising babies in
  Ohio''s hard water. It was Dorothy who suggested switching to Ivory soap when Gabriel
  developed that persistent diaper rash in September, and who taught Patricia to hang
  laundry on the line in the backyard to catch the brief autumn sun.


  The daily rhythm was industrial and communal: Robert left for his 7 AM shift at
  Hoover, walking the eight blocks down Elm to Maple Street where he caught the worker''s
  bus. Patricia would feed Gabriel his bottle while watching ''The Price is Right''
  on their small black-and-white Zenith television, the antenna wrapped in aluminum
  foil to catch the signal from Canton. Afternoons were spent on the front porch,
  Gabriel in his stroller, while Patricia chatted with the other young mothers - Linda
  Kowalski, who worked part-time at Woolworth''s, and Susan Martinez from across the
  street, whose husband drove truck for Republic Steel.


  The turning point came in November when Hoover announced the first round of layoffs.
  Robert''s job was safe - he was still new enough to be eager, experienced enough
  to be valuable - but the uncertainty settled over Elm Street like the early snow.
  Thanksgiving dinner that year was tense, with Robert''s brother Frank driving up
  from Akron to argue politics over Patricia''s attempt at turkey and stuffing. Gabriel,
  now sitting upright in the wooden high chair Robert had built in the basement workshop,
  banged his spoon against the tray while the adults debated whether the recession
  would reach Ohio, whether the factory jobs would last, whether this move had been
  a mistake.


  In this timeline, Gabriel''s first Christmas was spent not in familiar surroundings,
  but in the living room at 247 Elm Street, where a small artificial tree sat on the
  card table by the front window, decorated with construction paper ornaments that
  Amy Chen had made in her second-grade class and shared with the neighborhood children.
  The presents were practical: warm sleepers from Sears, a wooden teething ring that
  Robert had sanded smooth in the basement, and a soft cloth book that Dorothy Chen
  had sewn with fabric scraps from her own sewing projects.


  The house itself became a character in this alternate first year - the way the floorboards
  creaked in specific patterns when Patricia walked from the kitchen to Gabriel''s
  room for 2 AM feedings, the way the radiators clanged and hissed with steam heat
  that never quite warmed the corners, the way the back door stuck in humid weather
  and required a specific lift-and-push technique that Robert had mastered by March.


  By December, Gabriel had grown into the rhythms of Millfield: the factory whistle
  marking time, the sound of Mrs. Kowalski calling her twins in for dinner, the evening
  ritual of Robert coming home tired and oil-stained, washing his hands at the kitchen
  sink while Patricia reheated the pot roast or tuna casserole that had been keeping
  warm in the oven.


  This was a working-class infancy, measured not in milestones recorded in baby books,
  but in the practical negotiations of young parents making do: cloth diapers hung
  on the line because disposables were too expensive, formula mixed with the iron-heavy
  tap water that left rust stains in the bathroom sink, and lullabies sung over the
  ambient noise of a neighborhood where everyone worked shifts and someone was always
  coming or going.


  The snow that fell on Elm Street in December 1975 covered the same ground as in
  the original timeline, but in this version, it fell on a different house, different
  neighbors, a different version of Gabriel Walsh''s first winter - one shaped by
  the particular loneliness and community of industrial Ohio, by the specific friendships
  forged between young mothers far from their own families, by the daily rhythms of
  factory work and the quiet fears of economic uncertainty that would define the late
  1970s for so many American families.'
