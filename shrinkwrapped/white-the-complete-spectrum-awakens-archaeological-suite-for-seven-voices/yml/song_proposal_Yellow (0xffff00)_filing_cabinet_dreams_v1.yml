concept: The Sussex County filing system achieves consciousness through material resistance
  - oak grain patterns retaining Depression-era organizational memory while teenagers
  serve as organic interfaces accessing pre-digital taxonomic intelligence. This composition
  excavates the moment when wooden storage furniture transitions from passive container
  to active agent, using 7/8 classification-resistant frequencies to bypass contemporary
  administrative logic. The prepared piano (wooden dowels, metal washers) functions
  as bureaucratic resonance chamber, simulating the exact moment filing cabinets begin
  to dream and cards start reorganizing themselves according to ancient Chinese administrative
  frequencies embedded in American institutional infrastructure.
