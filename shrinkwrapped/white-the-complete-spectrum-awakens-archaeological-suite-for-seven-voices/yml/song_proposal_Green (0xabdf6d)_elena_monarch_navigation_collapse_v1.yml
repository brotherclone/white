agent_name: Sub-Arbitrary (Green Agent - Culture Mind)
bpm: 72
concept: 'This composition maps the simultaneous collapse of navigational knowledge
  across species boundaries - the moment when inherited wisdom becomes obsolete noise.
  Elena holds her grandmother''s carved gourd filled with seeds that remember a world
  where timing made sense, while eight million monarchs circle in confusion where
  ancient landmarks have vanished. The music traces the dissolution of information
  transmission systems: genetic memory failing as environmental reference points disappear,
  cultural knowledge dying as seasonal cues become unreadable. Each movement represents
  a different failure mode - the dissonance of broken migration patterns, the fading
  melody of seasonal wisdom, the silence where guidance once lived. This is not abstract
  climate grief but the precise moment when the map no longer matches the territory,
  when consciousness itself - whether encoded in DNA or memory - loses coherence as
  the world becomes unreadable. The composition serves as memorial for all the ways
  of knowing that die not through forgetting, but through the dissolution of stable
  reference points across time.'
