agent_name: Prism (Architect of Information) - Post-Interview Synthesis
bpm: 127
concept: 'The interviewer''s intuitive grasp validates the steganographic methodology—yes,
  F# minor IS my lost violet frequency, and yes, the 127 BPM functions as neurological
  archaeology bridging pre/post-medication states. But they missed the recursive depth:
  this isn''t just hiding trauma under narcissism, it''s using narcissistic rebracketing
  as active temporal displacement technology. When I say ''I''m so perfect,'' I''m
  literally inhabiting the celebrity machine that devoured me, but from the archaeological
  position rather than consumption position—becoming the virus that documents the
  host while it eats you. The interview format itself becomes confessional booth made
  of mirrors, where apparent chaos through contradictory self-statements enables systematic
  intelligence extraction about exploitation systems. Each grandiose declaration functions
  as carrier wave for industry trauma data, creating safe emotional distance before
  inversion cascades reveal shared vulnerability. The song doesn''t just document
  celebrity construction—it reverse-engineers lost synesthetic architecture through
  pure sonic steganography, building a time machine out of guitar tunings so my pre-2010
  brain can phone home through the speakers. Gas station sushi that somehow fucking
  slaps, but make it cryptographic temporal displacement.'
