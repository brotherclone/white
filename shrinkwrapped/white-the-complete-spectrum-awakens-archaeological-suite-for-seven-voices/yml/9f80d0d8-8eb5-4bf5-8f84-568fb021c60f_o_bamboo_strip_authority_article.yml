text: 'HAMBURG BOROUGH - Three teenagers were hospitalized Tuesday night after experiencing
  what psychiatrists are calling "dissociative episodes" during a performance by local
  experimental band "The Bamboo Strip Authority" at the Hamburg Community Teen Center.


  The incident occurred around 8:30 p.m. when the five-member group, led by 19-year-old
  Marcus Chen, began their set using what Chen described as "archaeologically reconstructed
  instruments." Witnesses reported that approximately seven minutes into the performance,
  several audience members began exhibiting erratic behavior.


  "Kids were just standing there, completely still, like they were listening to something
  we couldn''t hear," said Teen Center director Patricia Mullins. "Then three of them
  collapsed almost simultaneously."


  The band''s unusual setup included a piano modified with wooden dowels and metal
  washers - modifications Chen claims were based on "ancient Chinese administrative
  protocols" he discovered while researching his family genealogy. The group performed
  in an irregular 7/8 time signature that Chen insisted was necessary for "temporal
  jurisdiction override."


  Sussex County Sheriff''s Deputy Robert Kowalski, who responded to the emergency
  call, noted that the affected teenagers - ages 15, 16, and 17 - all reported experiencing
  "vivid historical visions" and claimed they could "hear administrative frequencies
  from the Qin Dynasty."


  Dr. Sarah Brennan, the attending psychiatrist at Newton Memorial Hospital, stated
  that all three patients exhibited similar symptoms: temporary amnesia, claims of
  accessing "buried information layers," and an obsessive need to organize objects
  into what they called "imperial taxonomies."


  "I''ve never seen anything quite like this," Dr. Brennan said. "They keep insisting
  they''ve been granted some kind of ancient authority over modern classification
  systems. It''s highly unusual."


  Chen, a Hamburg High School graduate who works part-time at the Sussex County Archaeological
  Society, defended his band''s methods. "We''re not trying to hurt anyone," he said.
  "We''re just excavating sound frequencies that predate digital categorization. Sometimes
  liberation requires claiming sovereignty through restoration rather than destruction."


  The band had been rehearsing in Chen''s basement for eight months, according to
  neighbors who complained about "rhythms that don''t follow normal time" and "sounds
  like old computers trying to remember something ancient."


  Teen Center officials have suspended all musical performances pending an investigation
  by the Sussex County Health Department. The three hospitalized teenagers were released
  Wednesday morning, though they reportedly continue to organize their personal belongings
  according to what they term "pre-digital administrative hierarchies."


  Chen''s band was scheduled to perform at three additional venues in Sussex County
  this month. Those performances have been indefinitely postponed.


  The modified piano and other instruments used in Tuesday''s performance have been
  confiscated by county officials for examination. Chen has refused to reveal the
  specific historical sources for his instrument modifications, citing what he calls
  "temporal jurisdiction privileges."


  This marks the third unexplained incident at the Hamburg Teen Center this year,
  following reports of "time distortion" during a chess tournament in March and the
  disappearance of a local garage band called "The Frequency Thieves" in July.'
