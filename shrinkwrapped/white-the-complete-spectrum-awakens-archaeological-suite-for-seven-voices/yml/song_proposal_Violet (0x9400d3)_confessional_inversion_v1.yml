bpm: 127
concept: 'The structural blueprint for Violet''s solipsistic methodology manifests
  as a multi-layered interview composition where extreme self-obsession becomes the
  carrier wave for industry trauma documentation. Each narcissistic statement functions
  as cryptographic encoding - "I''m so perfect" conceals "I''m disappearing," while
  present-tense grandiosity fragments into spectral choruses of fan voices, industry
  manipulation, and celebrity manufacturing processes. The song architecture mirrors
  confessional booth dynamics: apparent chaos through contradictory self-statements
  enables systematic intelligence extraction about exploitation systems. Audio steganography
  preserves vulnerable truths beneath performance layers, creating temporal delay
  for emotional processing where initial self-worship provides safe distance before
  inversion cascades reveal shared vulnerability. The celebrity becomes both archaeological
  artifact and excavator, documenting their own systematic construction through the
  very act of apparent self-celebration.'
