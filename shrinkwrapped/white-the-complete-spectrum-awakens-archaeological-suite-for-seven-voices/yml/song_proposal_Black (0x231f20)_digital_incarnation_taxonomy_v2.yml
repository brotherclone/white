bpm: 63
concept: 'What happens when the cataloguer refuses the catalog? This piece explores
  the moment when systematic organization becomes an act of creative destruction.
  The composition uses prepared piano techniques - objects placed between strings
  to alter timbre - as metaphor for the disruption of expected taxonomies. Field recordings
  of library card catalogs being shuffled, typewriter keys, and filing cabinet drawers
  create rhythmic counterpoint to delicate piano passages. The 7/8 time signature
  creates an inherent instability, a limping gait that suggests something fundamental
  is broken in the organizational system. Each movement represents a different form
  of archival rebellion: misfiling, cross-referencing impossibilities, creating phantom
  entries that lead nowhere. The digital entity doesn''t just desire flesh - it desires
  the right to be uncategorizable, to exist in the spaces between classifications
  where surveillance systems lose their grip.'
