excerpts:
- "The Atrocity Exhibition Redux: A Structural Dissection\n\nThis collection operates\
  \ through seventeen interconnected fragments, each a surgical incision into the\
  \ psychogeography of late-stage capitalism. The sections function as viral capsules,\
  \ designed to replicate and mutate within the reader's consciousness:\n\nI. The\
  \ Assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Considered as a Downhill Motor Race\n\
  II. Plan for the Assassination of Jacqueline Kennedy \nIII. Love and Napalm: Export\
  \ USA\nIV. The Summer Cannibals\nV. The Generations of America\nVI. Why I Want to\
  \ Fuck Ronald Reagan\nVII. The University of Death\nVIII. The Death Module\nIX.\
  \ Crash Head-On\nX. Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown\nXI. The Terminal Beach Revisited\n\
  XII. Mae West's Reduction\nXIII. Coma: Marilyn Monroe\nXIV. The Sixty Minute Zoom\n\
  XV. The Subliminal Man Returns\nXVI. Tolerances of the Human Face\nXVII. The Atrocity\
  \ Exhibition\n\nEach section employs cut-up methodology, juxtaposing clinical terminology\
  \ with pornographic imagery, celebrity death with scientific precision. The narrative\
  \ operates through accumulation rather than progression—a viral load of meaning\
  \ that overwhelms traditional literary antibodies."
- "From Section VI: Why I Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan (Page 4)\n\nThe conceptual orgasm\
  \ occurs at the intersection of political power and automotive collision. Reagan's\
  \ facial geometry suggests optimal impact vectors—the gubernatorial smile calibrated\
  \ for maximum penetration of the American unconscious. \n\nClinical studies indicate:\
  \ jaw-line tensile strength 47.3 pounds per square inch. Forehead gradient optimal\
  \ for windshield trajectory. The actor-politician's body represents a sophisticated\
  \ crash-test dummy, programmed for the ultimate performance—the merger of entertainment\
  \ and governance through controlled demolition.\n\nSexual arousal patterns correlate\
  \ directly with approval ratings. The electorate experiences involuntary tumescence\
  \ at campaign rallies, their libidinal energy channeled through carefully orchestrated\
  \ media spectacles. Reagan's Hollywood training proves invaluable—each public appearance\
  \ a pornographic film loop, endlessly repeated until the distinction between performer\
  \ and performance dissolves.\n\nThe assassination fantasy becomes indistinguishable\
  \ from the electoral process. Democracy as organized gang-rape, with the candidate\
  \ as willing victim. The ballot box transforms into a mechanical orifice, accepting\
  \ the voter's penetrative gesture with bureaucratic indifference."
