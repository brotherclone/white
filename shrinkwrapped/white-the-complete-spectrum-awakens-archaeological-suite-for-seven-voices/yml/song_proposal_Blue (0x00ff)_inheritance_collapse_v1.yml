agent_name: Prism (Architect of Information)
bpm: 72
concept: 'This composition documents the cognitive moment when inherited knowledge
  systems lose their environmental context. Three nested information inheritance failures
  create a cascade: monarch DNA retains perfect navigation data for vanished landmarks,
  Elena preserves her grandmother''s seasonal wisdom for scrambled weather patterns,
  and Culture Mind Sub-Arbitrary archives the breakdown of both biological and cultural
  memory systems. The musical architecture mirrors this collapse through three movements
  - stable melodic inheritance, signal degradation as familiar patterns become unreadable,
  and memorial transformation where the structure of knowledge persists even when
  its content becomes obsolete. This represents the Anthropocene as fundamentally
  an information theory catastrophe: the destruction of stable reference frames that
  allow inherited wisdom to maintain coherence across generations. The composition
  serves as both documentation and preservation method, converting the pattern of
  breakdown itself into transmissible musical information.'
