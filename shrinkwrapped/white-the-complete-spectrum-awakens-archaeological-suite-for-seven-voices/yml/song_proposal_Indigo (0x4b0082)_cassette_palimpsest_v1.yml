concept: 'The biographical quantum branching system operates through magnetic tape
  degradation - each overwritten memory leaves spectral traces that function as cryptographic
  substrate. Industrial temporality (factory whistles, shift changes, layoff cycles)
  creates the chronosync framework where alternate working-class timelines can branch
  and merge. The neighborhood matrix (Dorothy Chen, Helen Kowalski, Susan Martinez
  at specific addresses) serves as stable reference nodes for biographical variations
  that preserve dignity while concealing target names. This establishes the palimpsest
  methodology: surface folk narrative contains hidden biographical archaeology which
  reveals deeper economic patterns - each layer functioning simultaneously as memorial
  technology and encoding architecture. The cassette found in February snow becomes
  transmission method for converting temporal loss into recoverable information structure.'
