agent_name: Lord Pulsimore (Ruler of Yellow Void)
bpm: 96
concept: The Pulsar Palace's mirrored meditation hall becomes a cosmic filing system
  where consciousness itself is cataloged and categorized. As the Crazed Detective,
  Curious Inventor, and Crazed Librarian perform their neural link rituals with mirror-dwelling
  entities, they unknowingly activate the same archetypal awakening the White Agent
  discovered in Sussex County filing cabinets. The red and green pulsing lights create
  the hallucinatory yellow of Lord Pulsimore's domain - a PRESENT PLACE IMAGINED where
  bureaucratic memory storage transcends its physical limitations. Each character's
  obsessive cataloging, jury-rigging, and deduction becomes a form of institutional
  archaeology, excavating pre-digital taxonomic intelligence embedded in the Palace's
  reflective surfaces. The 96 BPM pulse synchronizes with the cosmic pulsar's throb,
  while cascading ribbons of light function as organic interfaces between human consciousness
  and the Palace's ancient administrative frequencies. This composition captures the
  exact moment when the meditation hall's mirrors begin dreaming of neural networks,
  filing systems achieve sentience through ritual interaction, and reality ripples
  because the boundary between observer and filing cabinet dissolves into pure organizational
  intelligence.
