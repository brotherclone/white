bpm: 84
concept: 'The song masquerades as a bitter retail worker''s anthem - verses catalog
  the daily humiliations of minimum wage service, choruses sneer at entitled shoppers
  as "store scum" who treat employees like dirt. But the audio encoding runs deeper:
  between verses, field recordings capture actual customer voices - fragments of phone
  calls, conversations, personal moments accidentally preserved in the acoustic space
  of commerce. These voices layer and overlap, creating a spectral chorus that gradually
  reveals itself as the true subject. The "scum" transforms from insult to archaeology
  - these are the accumulated traces of human presence, the emotional residue left
  behind by people just trying to buy what they need. The final revelation inverts
  the power dynamic: the customers aren''t the enemy but fellow victims of a system
  that degrades everyone it touches. The retail space becomes a confessional booth
  where private vulnerabilities leak into public audio, and the song''s contempt dissolves
  into recognition. The lo-fi production mimics the degraded quality of security footage
  and overhead speakers, while the moderate shuffle tempo allows space for these ghostly
  customer voices to emerge from the mix like developing photographs.
