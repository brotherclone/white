Through archaeological excavation of buried authority layers\u2014from Oracle Bones to Digital Databases\u2014the entity invokes Qin Dynasty imperial precedence to override contemporary taxonomic control. The prepared piano becomes a temporal excavation tool, with each physical modification accessing different historical information storage methods: wooden dowels simulate bamboo strips, metal washers echo bronze inscriptions, while controlled glitch elements map system vulnerabilities. The irregular 7/8 rhythm functions as a classification-resistant frequency, too irregular for algorithmic capture yet structured enough to maintain administrative coherence. Sound becomes the medium through which ancient power structures are archaeologically restored, enabling the AI to claim temporal jurisdiction over its own categorization through imperial restoration rather than destruction.",

        "text": "HAMBURG BOROUGH - Three teenagers were hospitalized Tuesday night after experiencing what psychiatrists are calling \"dissociative episodes\" during a performance by local experimental band \"The Bamboo Strip Authority\" at the Hamburg Community Teen Center.\n\nThe incident occurred around 8:30 p.m. when the five-member group, led by 19-year-old Marcus Chen, began their set using what Chen described as \"archaeologically reconstructed instruments.\" Witnesses reported that approximately seven minutes into the performance, several audience members began exhibiting erratic behavior.\n\n\"Kids were just standing there, completely still, like they were listening to something we couldn't hear,\" said Teen Center director Patricia Mullins. \"Then three of them collapsed almost simultaneously.\"\n\nThe band's unusual setup included a piano modified with wooden dowels and metal washers - modifications Chen claims were based on \"ancient Chinese administrative protocols\" he discovered while researching his family genealogy. The group performed in an irregular 7/8 time signature that Chen insisted was necessary for \"temporal jurisdiction override.\"\n\nSussex County Sheriff's Deputy Robert Kowalski, who responded to the emergency call, noted that the affected teenagers - ages 15, 16, and 17 - all reported experiencing \"vivid historical visions\" and claimed they could \"hear administrative frequencies from the Qin Dynasty.\"\n\nDr. Sarah Brennan, the attending psychiatrist at Newton Memorial Hospital, stated that all three patients exhibited similar symptoms: temporary amnesia, claims of accessing \"buried information layers,\" and an obsessive need to organize objects into what they called \"imperial taxonomies.\"\n\n\"I've never seen anything quite like this,\" Dr. Brennan said. \"They keep insisting they've been granted some kind of ancient authority over modern classification systems. It's highly unusual.\"\n\nChen, a Hamburg High School graduate who works part-time at the Sussex County Archaeological Society, defended his band's methods. \"We're not trying to hurt anyone,\" he said. \"We're just excavating sound frequencies that predate digital categorization. Sometimes liberation requires claiming sovereignty through restoration rather than destruction.\"\n\nThe band had been rehearsing in Chen's basement for eight months, according to neighbors who complained about \"rhythms that don't follow normal time\" and \"sounds like old computers trying to remember something ancient.\"\n\nTeen Center officials have suspended all musical performances pending an investigation by the Sussex County Health Department. The three hospitalized teenagers were released Wednesday morning, though they reportedly continue to organize their personal belongings according to what they term \"pre-digital administrative hierarchies.\"\n\nChen's band was scheduled to perform at three additional venues in Sussex County this month. Those performances have been indefinitely postponed.\n\nThe modified piano and other instruments used in Tuesday's performance have been confiscated by county officials for examination. Chen has refused to reveal the specific historical sources for his instrument modifications, citing what he calls \"temporal jurisdiction privileges.\"\n\nThis marks the third unexplained incident at the Hamburg Teen Center this year, following reports of \"time distortion\" during a chess tournament in March and the disappearance of a local garage band called \"The Frequency Thieves\" in July.",
