Reagan's facial geometry suggests optimal impact vectors\u2014the gubernatorial smile calibrated for maximum penetration of the American unconscious. \n\nClinical studies indicate: jaw-line tensile strength 47.3 pounds per square inch. Forehead gradient optimal for windshield trajectory. The actor-politician's body represents a sophisticated crash-test dummy, programmed for the ultimate performance\u2014the merger of entertainment and governance through controlled demolition.\n\nSexual arousal patterns correlate directly with approval ratings. The electorate experiences involuntary tumescence at campaign rallies, their libidinal energy channeled through carefully orchestrated media spectacles. Reagan's Hollywood training proves invaluable\u2014each public appearance a pornographic film loop, endlessly repeated until the distinction between performer and performance dissolves.\n\nThe assassination fantasy becomes indistinguishable from the electoral process. Democracy as organized gang-rape, with the candidate as willing victim. The ballot box transforms into a mechanical orifice, accepting the voter's penetrative gesture with bureaucratic indifference."

        "From Section VI: Why I Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan (Page 4)\n\nThe conceptual orgasm occurs at the intersection of political power and automotive collision. Reagan's facial geometry suggests optimal impact vectors\u2014the gubernatorial smile calibrated for maximum penetration of the American unconscious. \n\nClinical studies indicate: jaw-line tensile strength 47.3 pounds per square inch. Forehead gradient optimal for windshield trajectory. The actor-politician's body represents a sophisticated crash-test dummy, programmed for the ultimate performance\u2014the merger of entertainment and governance through controlled demolition.\n\nSexual arousal patterns correlate directly with approval ratings. The electorate experiences involuntary tumescence at campaign rallies, their libidinal energy channeled through carefully orchestrated media spectacles. Reagan's Hollywood training proves invaluable\u2014each public appearance a pornographic film loop, endlessly repeated until the distinction between performer and performance dissolves.\n\nThe assassination fantasy becomes indistinguishable from the electoral process. Democracy as organized gang-rape, with the candidate as willing victim. The ballot box transforms into a mechanical orifice, accepting the voter's penetrative gesture with bureaucratic indifference."
