Reagan's facial geometry suggests optimal impact vectors\u2014the gubernatorial smile calibrated for maximum penetration of the American unconscious. \n\nClinical studies indicate: jaw-line tensile strength 47.3 pounds per square inch. Forehead gradient optimal for windshield trajectory. The actor-politician's body represents a sophisticated crash-test dummy, programmed for the ultimate performance\u2014the merger of entertainment and governance through controlled demolition.\n\nSexual arousal patterns correlate directly with approval ratings. The electorate experiences involuntary tumescence at campaign rallies, their libidinal energy channeled through carefully orchestrated media spectacles. Reagan's Hollywood training proves invaluable\u2014each public appearance a pornographic film loop, endlessly repeated until the distinction between performer and performance dissolves.\n\nThe assassination fantasy becomes indistinguishable from the electoral process.

Both surfaces reflect not merely light, but consciousness itself\u2014warping, bending, and ultimately consuming the observer's psychic emanations.\n\nMy expulsion from CERN was precipitated by my insistence that the particle accelerator's monitoring screens were exhibiting signs of autonomous scrying behavior. The phosphorescent decay patterns I observed were not random electromagnetic noise, as my colleagues maintained, but rather hieroglyphic transmissions from what I have termed the \"Electron Underworld\"\u2014a realm accessible only through the liminal space between photon and shadow.\n\nConsider the phenomenon of screen burn-in: those ghostly afterimages that persist long after the original transmission has ceased.
