daily_routine: Each dawn, Elena walked the traditional route markers, checking for
  the native plants that once guided seasonal movements - milkweed, asters, goldenrod.
  She maintained a seed library of heritage varieties, taught children traditional
  weather reading, and coordinated with other families about seasonal migration timing.
  By 2034, she spends her days documenting disappearing plant communities and trying
  to adapt traditional knowledge to unpredictable climate patterns.

- displacement
environmental_stressor: Habitat destruction through industrial agriculture expansion
  and pesticide contamination of traditional seasonal camps
family_situation: Daughter works in Mexico City, disconnected from traditional knowledge.
  Grandchildren speak only Spanish, not the indigenous language that contains the
  migration wisdom. Extended family scattered across borders, seasonal gathering patterns
  broken.

final_thought: The children will never know which stars to follow, which plants mean
  it's time to move. We were the memory keepers, and the memory is dying with us.
last_days_scenario: Elena sits in the abandoned seasonal camp where her grandmother
  taught her to read weather patterns in milkweed growth. The corporate soy fields
  stretch endlessly where diverse native plants once guided her people's movements.
  Her daughter, working in Mexico City, doesn't know the old routes - the knowledge
  dies with Elena. She holds her grandmother's carved gourd, filled with seeds from
  plants that no longer grow here, poisoned by the same chemicals that killed the
  monarchs. The timing is all wrong now anyway - spring comes when winter should,
  the rains when drought is expected. Even if the plants survived, even if her daughter
  remembered, the seasons themselves have become unreadable.

vulnerability_details: Like monarchs whose multi-generational migration requires each
  generation to know the next stage, Elena's family carried indigenous agricultural
  knowledge across seasonal migrations for centuries - but climate disruption broke
  the timing, and corporate monoculture poisoned the traditional waypoints where her
  people would rest and gather food
