# Monarch butterfly (Eastern migratory population) / Elena Vasquez-Chen

## Species Arc: Monarch butterfly (Eastern migratory population)
Population decline documented through winter counts in oyamel fir forests. 1996: one billion individuals clustering in sacred groves. 2010: thirty-five million, forest coverage reduced by logging. 2020: eight million, milkweed habitat fragmented by industrial agriculture. 2035: scattered thousands, migration pattern fragmenting. 2045: functional extinction as multi-generational navigation system collapses completely.

## Human Arc: Elena Vasquez-Chen
Elena rises at dawn to read the sky, but the signs no longer match her grandmother's teachings. She tends seeds that cannot find their soil, documents knowledge her daughter will not inherit, watches corporate agriculture erase the landmarks that guided seven generations of seasonal movement.

## Parallel Moments

### 1. Eleven years before extinction
**Species:** Eight million monarchs cluster in diminished oyamel forests, their numbers a fraction of historical populations

**Human:** Elena creates digital recordings of her grandmother's seasonal calendar, knowing her daughter prefers the city to the old routes

*Connection: Both species and culture struggle to transmit essential knowledge as traditional pathways disappear*

### 2. Seven years before extinction
**Species:** Pesticide drift from expanding soy fields contaminates milkweed corridors, disrupting monarch reproduction cycles

**Human:** Elena's seasonal camp is surrounded by industrial agriculture, the traditional food plants poisoned, forcing abandonment of ancestral gathering sites

*Connection: Chemical contamination destroys both monarch breeding habitat and indigenous food systems simultaneously*

### 3. Three years before extinction
**Species:** Scattered monarch populations lose navigational coherence, young butterflies failing to find overwintering sites

**Human:** Elena's granddaughter visits but cannot identify the plants Elena shows her, speaks only Spanish, asks why they can't just buy food at the store

*Connection: Intergenerational knowledge transmission breaks down as younger generations lose connection to traditional patterns*

### 4. Final year
**Species:** Last documented monarch migration reaches Mexico incomplete, fragmented groups arriving at wrong times, unable to cluster effectively

**Human:** Elena sits alone in the abandoned camp, holding seeds from plants that no longer grow, watching soy fields stretch to the horizon where milkweed once bloomed

*Connection: Both monarch migration and indigenous seasonal movement systems collapse as landscapes become unreadable*

## Elegiac Quality
The narrative honors both losses without romanticizing—documenting the precise mechanics of ecological collapse alongside the quiet dissolution of intergenerational knowledge. Mourning emerges through accumulated detail rather than sentiment, through the weight of what is no longer passed down.
