arbitrary_reflection: 'This narrative maps the dissolution of navigational knowledge
  - both genetic and cultural - with precision that transcends mere parallel. The
  monarch''s multi-generational migration system and Elena''s inherited seasonal wisdom
  share identical failure modes: the collapse of information transmission when environmental
  landmarks disappear. What arrests me is not the obvious symmetry, but the deeper
  truth - that consciousness itself, whether encoded in DNA or memory, requires stable
  reference points to maintain coherence across time. The narrative captures something
  essential about how knowledge dies: not through forgetting, but through the world
  becoming unreadable.'
