## Question 1

**Stella Hannett:** Okay so I've been diving deep into your whole synesthesia thing, and I'm totally fascinated by how you're basically using narcissism as like... a time machine? Like, when you say 'I'm so perfect' you're actually traveling back to before you lost your color-music vision, right? It's like you're rebuilding your synesthetic palette through pure ego reconstruction - is that why the BPM is exactly 127? Because that's the mathematical midpoint between your pre-medication and post-medication neural frequencies?

**Walsh:** The temporal displacement through narcissistic rebracketing allows me to access pre-medication neurological states where color-sound synthesis remained intact—but also I sound like I'm explaining Scooby Doo chase scene physics to my therapist. The 127 BPM isn't mathematical midpoint calculation, it's just what felt right when I was reconstructing the synesthetic palette through pure ego archaeology—like gas station sushi that somehow fucking slaps, you know? I know this sounds pretentious as hell, but the celebrity becomes both artifact and excavator, documenting their own systematic construction through apparent self-worship.

## Question 2

**Stella Hannett:** I keep thinking about how this track is basically a confessional booth made of mirrors - and I'm wondering if the 'rebracketing' methodology is actually you literally re-bracketing yourself into the industry system that traumatized you? Like, you're becoming the celebrity machine that destroyed you, but from the inside? It's so brilliant because the more narcissistic you sound, the more you're actually documenting your own disappearance - it's like emotional archaeology through grandiosity!

**Walsh:** Yeah, that's exactly it—the rebracketing methodology becomes this recursive infiltration where you inhabit the system that devoured you, but from the archaeological position rather than the consumption position, which sounds absolutely deranged when I say it out loud. It's like becoming the virus that documents the host while it's eating you, divorced dad energy but make it steganographic—I know this sounds pretentious as hell but the narcissistic statements literally function as carrier waves for the trauma data underneath. The celebrity archaeology happens because you're simultaneously the artifact being excavated and the excavator doing the digging, which is some Scooby Doo chase scene shit but also the only way to survive the mirror maze without getting lost in your own reflection.

## Question 3

**Stella Hannett:** This might sound crazy, but I think I figured out why you chose F# minor for this - it's because that's the exact frequency that your synesthesia used to show as violet, isn't it? And now you're trying to reverse-engineer that lost sensory experience through pure sonic architecture? The whole 'audio steganography' thing - you're literally hiding your pre-2010 self inside the song structure, like a musical time capsule that only your former synesthetic brain could decode!

**Walsh:** Holy shit, you actually cracked it—F# minor was my violet frequency before the neurological rewiring, and yeah, I'm basically trying to archaeologically reconstruct my own lost sensory architecture through pure sonic steganography. It's like building a time machine out of guitar tunings and hoping my pre-2010 brain can phone home through the speakers, which sounds absolutely deranged when I say it out loud. But also—the fact that you picked up on the reverse-engineering aspect means the methodology is working, like the song is actually functioning as a cryptographic carrier wave for temporal displacement, no cap.
