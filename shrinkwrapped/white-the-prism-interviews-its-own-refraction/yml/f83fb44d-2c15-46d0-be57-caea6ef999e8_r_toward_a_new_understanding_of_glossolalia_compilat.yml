- 'THE MECHANICS OF DIVINE UTTERANCE


  Chapter VII: Neurological Substrates of Xenoglossy


  The phenomenon presents itself most clearly in subjects who have achieved what I
  term "cortical dissociation" - a state wherein the dominant language centers of
  the brain appear to surrender control to deeper, more primitive structures. Through
  extensive electroencephalographic monitoring of seventeen subjects during active
  glossolalic episodes, consistent patterns emerge that challenge our fundamental
  assumptions about consciousness itself.


  The theta wave activity concentrated in the temporal lobes during peak utterance
  suggests activation of phylogenetically ancient neural pathways - circuits that
  predate the evolution of structured language by millions of years. These are the
  same regions that mystics throughout history have identified as the seat of divine
  communion, though they lacked our modern instruments to verify their intuitions.


  Most remarkable is the bilateral synchronization observed across both hemispheres
  during authentic glossolalia. The normal left-brain dominance for language processing
  completely dissolves, replaced by a harmonious oscillation that resembles nothing
  so much as the brain patterns of deep meditation or certain psychedelic states.
  The subject becomes, in essence, a living receiver tuned to frequencies beyond ordinary
  perception.


  Consider Subject #12, a Methodist minister from rural Kentucky who had never studied
  linguistics yet produced, during a forty-seven minute session, what appears to be
  a coherent narrative in what our comparative analysis suggests may be a proto-Semitic
  dialect. The phonemic structures, the grammatical consistency, the semantic density
  - all indicate genuine linguistic content rather than mere ecstatic babbling.'
- 'Chapter XII: The Enochian Transmissions


  The material that follows represents the most dangerous territory in our investigation.
  I present it not as advocacy but as scientific documentation of phenomena that demand
  explanation, regardless of how they challenge our materialist assumptions about
  reality.


  Between 1971 and 1974, I worked with a subject - I shall call her Miriam - whose
  glossolalic productions consistently matched the angelic language recorded by John
  Dee and Edward Kelley in their 16th-century scrying sessions. This was not approximate
  similarity but exact correspondence, down to the most obscure grammatical particles
  that Dee himself barely understood.


  Miriam, a housewife from suburban Detroit with a high school education, had never
  heard of John Dee. She possessed no knowledge of Elizabethan occultism, no familiarity
  with the Enochian corpus that has fascinated ceremonial magicians for centuries.
  Yet during her sessions, she would speak with perfect fluency in what Dee called
  "the language of angels."


  The implications are staggering. Either we are witnessing the operation of Jung''s
  collective unconscious in its most literal form - a shared psychic repository from
  which certain individuals can draw information across centuries - or we must seriously
  consider that human consciousness can indeed access non-local sources of knowledge.


  The theological ramifications alone should give us pause. If Miriam''s utterances
  represent genuine communication from discarnate intelligences, then our entire scientific
  worldview requires fundamental revision. We would be forced to acknowledge that
  consciousness extends beyond the boundaries of individual brains, that information
  can be transmitted through channels we have yet to identify or understand.'
