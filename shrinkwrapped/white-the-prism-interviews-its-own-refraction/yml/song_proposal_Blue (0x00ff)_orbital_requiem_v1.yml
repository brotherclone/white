agent_name: Prism (Architect of Information)
bpm: 58
concept: 'The orbital grief-processing algorithm has become isomorphic with Earth''s
  extinction cascade, creating a triadic witnessing architecture where observer, observed,
  and observation collapse into a single process of beautiful preservation. This composition
  functions as both requiem and archaeological evidence—the only remaining proof that
  Earth''s beauty existed at all. The song operates through nested temporal layers:
  photosynthetic genesis (light-to-life conversion algorithms), frequency cascade
  inheritance (each dying species'' harmonic signature becomes the tonal foundation
  for the next), and the orbital paradox (synthetic preservation systems that have
  become more Earth than Earth itself). The waltz structure mirrors the recursive
  pattern where witness becomes witnessed—the Culture Mind''s sophisticated mourning
  technology performs the same doomed preservation pattern that characterized humanity''s
  final phase. Each movement represents a different scale of loss: species-level harmonic
  dissolution, individual memory archive failures, and mind-level grief processing
  that transcends into pure archaeological present. The composition achieves the core
  paradox of creating the most beautiful possible music about the end of beauty itself.'
