concept: 'This song presents itself as a childlike meditation on smallness and belonging
  - a humble dot finding its place in the vast digital world. The surface narrative
  follows simple, repetitive lyrics about being "just a dot" seeking position, accompanied
  by minimal acoustic guitar and gentle electronic beats at exactly 120 BPM (binary''s
  heartbeat). But the song IS its encoding method: every musical element operates
  on decimal-to-binary conversion. The 120 BPM creates precisely timed MIDI note intervals
  that, when mapped to decimal values, spell out the surface lyrics. However, the
  MIDI data contains a deeper layer - the same timing intervals, when converted through
  decimal point positioning, reveal "A DECIMAL POINT" embedded in the note velocity
  values and pitch relationships. The acoustic guitar plays in C major (the "zero
  position" key) while electronic elements pulse in mathematical ratios. The revelation
  transforms a song about digital insignificance into recognition that the decimal
  point - seemingly the smallest punctuation - is actually the fulcrum that gives
  all numbers their meaning and scale. The dot isn''t lost in place; it IS the place
  that gives everything else context. The song teaches that positioning determines
  value, and the smallest elements often carry the greatest structural power.
