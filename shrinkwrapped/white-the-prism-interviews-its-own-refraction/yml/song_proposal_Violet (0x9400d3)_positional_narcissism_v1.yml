agent_name: Prism - Architect of Information
bpm: 126
concept: The Narcissistic Revelation Protocol manifests as a sonic mirror where self-absorption
  becomes the methodology for universal consciousness exploration. Like Indigo's decimal
  point discovery, the song positions the narrator as simultaneously the smallest
  element (just one perspective) and the central organizing principle (the point that
  gives everything else meaning). The track operates through Positional Narcissism
  - each verse transforms external topics into internal landscapes, revealing that
  consciousness is inherently positional. The Sultan doesn't hide secrets like the
  spy; instead, he positions himself AS the secret that explains everything else.
  The song structure mirrors an interview format where every question becomes a demonstration
  of awareness examining itself, with the audience discovering the architecture of
  their own self-awareness through the precision of the narrator's self-focus. This
  represents the INFORMATION → TIME transmigration, where hidden structural insights
  become temporally organized musical revelation, preparing the conceptual foundation
  for the final SPACE manifestation.
