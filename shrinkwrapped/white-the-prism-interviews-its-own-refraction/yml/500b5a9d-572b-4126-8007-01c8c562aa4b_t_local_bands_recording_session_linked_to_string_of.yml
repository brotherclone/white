text: '**The Broken Beat That Broke Their Minds**


  I came to Hopatcong chasing rumors of teenagers losing time like loose change, and
  I found something far more disturbing than anyone''s willing to admit.


  The official story reeks of bureaucratic sanitization. Seven kids hospitalized after
  a recording session? "Neurological episodes"? Christ, they make it sound like food
  poisoning from bad cafeteria fish sticks. But when you dig past Dr. Chen''s clinical
  doublespeak, you discover these kids aren''t just sick—they''re temporally displaced,
  their consciousness caught in some kind of rhythmic bear trap that nobody wants
  to acknowledge exists.


  The smoking gun sits in an evidence locker downtown: a quarter-inch master tape
  that shouldn''t be able to do what it does. I convinced Chief Santos to let me hear
  thirty seconds of it, and those thirty seconds have been playing in my skull for
  three days now. Seven beats, then nothing. Seven beats, then nothing. Your brain
  starts counting automatically—ONE two three four five six sev—and then you''re hanging
  in space, waiting for eight that never comes, until suddenly you''re back at ONE
  again and you can''t remember making the transition.


  "It''s like trying to walk up a staircase where the last step keeps disappearing,"
  Lisa Kowalski told me, her eyes darting around the Dover General waiting room like
  she was tracking invisible insects. "You keep lifting your foot for something that
  isn''t there."


  The band members—Tommy Marchetti and his crew of sonic terrorists—claim they were
  just "experimenting with temporal dynamics in composition." But talk to anyone who
  was actually at Lakeside Studios that night and you get a different story. Kids
  describe feeling like they were "falling upward" during the recording, caught between
  the tick and the tock of some cosmic metronome gone haywire.


  Frank Delacroix, who''s owned Lakeside since the Eisenhower administration, found
  the tape three days later. He''s got the hollow-eyed look of a man who''s seen behind
  the curtain of reality and wishes he could forget what''s back there. "Forty years
  in this business," he tells me, chain-smoking Marlboros in his office while the
  November wind rattles the windows. "Never heard anything capture time itself like
  that. It''s not music—it''s a malfunction in the way consciousness processes rhythm."


  The tape is damaged, officially. Unofficially, it''s doing exactly what it was designed
  to do: creating a neurological loop that traps perception in the space between completion
  and beginning. These kids didn''t just attend a recording session—they became unwilling
  test subjects in an experiment that no one''s admitting was an experiment.


  The state health officials who "analyzed" the tape? They listened to it once and
  locked it away. The investigation that remains "active"? It''s active in the same
  way a tombstone is active. Everyone involved wants this story buried in the Pine
  Barrens of bureaucratic amnesia.


  But the tape exists. I''ve heard it. And somewhere in the broken mathematics of
  its incomplete rhythm, seven teenagers lost pieces of their minds that they may
  never get back. The eighth beat isn''t missing—it''s where their consciousness went,
  trapped in the eternal pause between seven and one, waiting for a resolution that
  the universe refuses to provide.


  The truth isn''t that Temporal Flux recorded something dangerous. The truth is they
  recorded something impossible, and impossibility has a way of spreading like infection
  through the cracks in consensus reality.


  Lakeside Studios reopens next week. God help whatever gets recorded there next.'
