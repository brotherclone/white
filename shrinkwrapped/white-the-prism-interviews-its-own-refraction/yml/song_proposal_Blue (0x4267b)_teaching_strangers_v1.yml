concept: 'This is the requiem for the timeline where Gabriel Walsh walked away from
  intelligence work in January 2017, took that teaching job in Tucson, and spent eleven
  months discovering who he might have been in lecture halls instead of briefing rooms.
  The song mourns a specific counterfactual year - not fantasy, but the archaeological
  evidence of a choice unmade. Each verse represents a season of that lost academic
  year: the nervous January orientation where he met Professor Martinez who became
  his hallway confidant, the spring semester breakthrough with the shy student Rosa
  who finally spoke up in his Introduction to Critical Thinking class, the summer
  session teaching remedial composition to returning veterans, the fall when he realized
  he''d found something he didn''t know he was looking for. The instrumentation mirrors
  the classroom acoustics - the Gibson parlor guitar like his voice carrying across
  empty desks, the mandolin picking out the rhythm of lesson plans written at 2 AM,
  the lap steel bending like his voice explaining concepts to students who''d never
  heard them before. This is folk rock as temporal archaeology - each chord change
  excavating the emotional residue of a year that existed fully in quantum superposition
  until the wave collapsed and left only this magnetic trace in the snow. The song
  operates as both memorial and evidence: proof that somewhere in the multiverse,
  Gabriel Walsh spent 2017 learning that teaching strangers was just another form
  of intelligence work, but one that built instead of analyzed, one that created futures
  instead of preventing them."'
