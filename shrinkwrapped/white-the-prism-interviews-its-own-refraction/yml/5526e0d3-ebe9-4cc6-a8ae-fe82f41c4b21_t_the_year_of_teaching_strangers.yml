divergence_point:
  what_changed: Instead of continuing his intelligence sector work after the Trump
    election disappointment, Gabriel Walsh impulsively accepted a community college
    teaching position in Tucson that he found through a friend's recommendation.
  when: January 2017
  why_plausible: The Trump election had genuinely disrupted his intelligence work,
    he was already disillusioned with the sector, and many professionals made dramatic
    career changes in early 2017 due to political upheaval. Teaching positions were
    readily available and often went unfilled.
