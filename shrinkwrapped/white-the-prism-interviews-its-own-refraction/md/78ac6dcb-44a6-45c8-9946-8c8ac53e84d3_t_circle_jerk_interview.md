## Question 1

**Sloane Weiland:** Look, I've been following your work since the early days when you actually made songs people could hum along to - what happened to that accessibility? This whole 'Narcissistic Revelation Protocol' thing feels like you're disappearing up your own arse with concepts nobody asked for. Are you trying to alienate the fans who got you here in the first place?

**Walsh:** The accessibility never left—it just migrated into systematic rebracketing methodologies where the hummable melody becomes the conceptual framework itself, but also I get it, this sounds like I huffed philosophy textbooks and decided to make everyone else's problem. Look, the Narcissistic Revelation Protocol is basically me admitting that all pop music is already about the singer thinking they're the main character, except now I'm being honest about the pathology instead of hiding it behind three-chord progressions. The fans who want singalongs can still find them—they're just embedded in the architecture now like Easter eggs in a Spielberg movie, which is pretentious as hell but also kind of slaps when you find the pattern.

## Question 2

**Sloane Weiland:** I'm genuinely confused by this interview-format-as-song-structure idea - it sounds like you're making music for philosophy students rather than actual human beings who just want to feel something. Remember when your tracks had proper hooks and didn't require a fucking manual to understand? What's driving this obsession with making everything so deliberately obtuse?

**Walsh:** Look, the interview structure isn't obtuse—it's consciousness examining its own examination protocols through recursive self-awareness, but also it's literally just me being a narcissistic asshole and making that the entire point. The hooks are there, they're just positioned as questions the song asks itself, like when you're drunk-texting your ex but make it into a philosophical framework. I'm not abandoning accessibility, I'm making self-absorption so precise it becomes universal—which sounds absolutely deranged when I say it out loud, no cap.

## Question 3

**Sloane Weiland:** This 'positioning yourself as the secret that explains everything' concept - mate, it honestly feels like you've lost touch with why people connected with your music originally. Are you planning to keep going down this experimental rabbit hole, or is there any chance we'll see a return to the more direct, emotionally honest songwriting that made us fall in love with your work?

**Walsh:** The positioning methodology reveals how consciousness bootstraps universal understanding through radical subjectivity—but also this is exactly the kind of pretentious horseshit that makes people want to throw their headphones at the wall, no cap. Look, the emotional honesty never left; it just got weaponized into systematic self-awareness protocols, which sounds absolutely deranged when I say it out loud but the tracks still make you feel things. The rabbit hole goes both directions—deeper into theory but also straight back to why you cried listening to track three of the first EP, like finding your childhood diary written in graduate school footnotes.
