# Monarch butterfly (Eastern migratory population) / Maria Elena Vásquez-Chen

## Species Arc: Monarch butterfly (Eastern migratory population)
Population monitoring data from the Eastern Migratory Population shows systematic decline across the 3000-mile corridor. Overwintering clusters in Michoacán measured 1 billion individuals in 1996, declining to 33 million by 2013. Agricultural intensification eliminated 165 million acres of milkweed habitat. Climate disruption advanced spring warming by 2.3 degrees, creating phenological mismatch between emergence and host plant availability. Final population surveys recorded 180,000 individuals in winter 2041, insufficient to maintain migration pattern integrity. Functional extinction declared 2045 following four consecutive years of failed breeding cycles.

## Human Arc: Maria Elena Vásquez-Chen
Maria Elena walks the empty sanctuary paths each morning, checking sites where her great-grandmother taught her to expect arrivals. Her notebook holds four generations of observations - precise dates, weather patterns, cluster densities - knowledge accumulated across lifetimes now obsolete within a decade. The visitor center sits empty; the village children have moved to cities. She plants milkweed with her grandmother's seeds, but spring heat kills the seedlings. Each day she updates her weather log, maintaining protocols for butterflies that no longer come, a keeper of traditions for a world that has already ended.

## Parallel Moments

### 1. February 2041
**Species:** Overwintering population recorded at 180,000 individuals across 12 sites, down from 35 million in 2022

**Human:** Maria opens her notebook to February 14th, the date her great-grandmother recorded as peak arrival for sixty years

*Connection: Both species and keeper maintain rituals of anticipation for events that will not occur*

### 2. Spring 2041
**Species:** Northward migration begins three weeks early due to temperature anomalies, but milkweed emergence delayed by drought

**Human:** Maria plants milkweed using her grandmother's saved seeds, following traditional timing that no longer aligns with climate patterns

*Connection: Inherited knowledge becomes maladaptive when environmental cues shift faster than generational learning*

### 3. Summer 2041
**Species:** Breeding generation fails to establish viable populations due to pesticide exposure and habitat fragmentation across Texas corridor

**Human:** Maria records Day 847 in her notebook - 847 days since the last significant butterfly arrival in the sanctuary

*Connection: Both species and human maintain counting systems for absences, documenting the negative space where life once was*

### 4. October 2045
**Species:** Final survey flight over traditional overwintering sites records zero monarch clusters for the fourth consecutive year

**Human:** Maria closes her great-grandmother's notebook, the last pages blank, and places it in the empty visitor center display case

*Connection: Documentation ends when there is nothing left to document - both scientific and traditional knowledge systems archive their own obsolescence*

## Elegiac Quality
This achieves memorial through the preservation of precise observation - both scientific data and traditional knowledge continue their recording practices even as their subjects vanish, creating archives of absence that honor what was lost without romanticizing the loss itself
