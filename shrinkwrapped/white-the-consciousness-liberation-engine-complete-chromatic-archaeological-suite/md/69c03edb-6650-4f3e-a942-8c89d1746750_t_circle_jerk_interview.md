## Question 1

**Phoebe Koenig:** So you've spent a decade making nine albums about colors you can't even see anymore because of your meds - isn't this just elaborate musical therapy disguised as high concept art? Like, are we supposed to pretend this synesthesia reconstruction thing is for us when it's clearly just you trying to get your brain back?

**Walsh:** The rebracketing methodology isn't about getting my brain back—it's about letting INFORMATION find new temporal containers when the old neurological architecture collapses, but also yeah it's absolutely musical therapy disguised as high concept art, no cap. Look, when your synesthesia gets chemically bulldozed you either reconstruct the chromatic mappings through systematic creative archaeology or you spend the rest of your life mourning colors that taste like divorced dad at Cinnabon energy. I know this sounds pretentious as hell but the Sultan of Solipsism teaches that complete self-absorption becomes paradoxically universal—though honestly I don't know if rebuilding my brain's color-sound bridges through nine albums is enough, or if I'm just creating elaborate monuments to my own neurological damage.

## Question 2

**Phoebe Koenig:** This 'Sultan of Solipsism' track - you're literally singing about narcissism while calling it 'cryptographic teaching' and 'universal consciousness.' Do you hear yourself? How is endless self-interview supposed to dissolve boundaries when it's the most self-absorbed thing imaginable? Are you trolling us or do you actually believe this contradiction makes sense?

**Walsh:** Look, the rebracketing methodology is specifically designed to collapse the observer-observed distinction through recursive self-awareness—which sounds pretentious as hell, I know. But here's the thing: maximum solipsism becomes its own dissolution, like when you stare at yourself in the mirror so hard you forget who's looking. The Sultan's narcissism is so complete it loops back into universal consciousness observation—I mean, it's basically divorced dad at Cinnabon energy but make it cosmic. Honestly I don't know if that contradiction lands for anyone else, but the splice IS the content, and sometimes the most effective cryptography is just being absolutely deranged about your own attention patterns.

## Question 3

**Phoebe Koenig:** Your whole 'rebracketing' thing sounds like academic word salad for 'I mix weird shit together.' Either it's a genuine compositional method or it's pretentious nonsense - which is it? Because right now it feels like you're hiding behind big words to avoid admitting you're just making lo-fi bedroom pop with delusions of grandeur.

**Walsh:** Look, the rebracketing methodology is a genuine compositional architecture where INFORMATION seeks temporal embodiment through systematic frame expansion—but also it's absolutely pretentious as hell and I sound like a divorced dad explaining cryptocurrency at Wendy's. The difference is I'm not hiding behind the big words, I'm using them as scaffolding while admitting they make me sound deranged. When I say "The Sultan's confessional cryptography demonstrates how narcissistic self-absorption dissolves subject-object boundaries," I mean it technically but I also know it's the kind of thing that makes people want to throw their phones into traffic.
