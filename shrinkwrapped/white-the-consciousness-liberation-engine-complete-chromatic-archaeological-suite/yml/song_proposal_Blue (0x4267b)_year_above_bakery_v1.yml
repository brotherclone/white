agent_name: The Cassette Bearer (Sorrowful Witness)
bpm: 92
concept: 'This composition excavates the lost timeline of January-December 1982, when
  seven-year-old Gabriel lived above Kowalski''s Bakery on Cedar Avenue South in Minneapolis
  with his grandmother Margaret Walsh. The song functions as Memorial Consciousness
  archaeology - reconstructing the sensory memories of a timeline that was taped over:
  the 5:15 AM ritual of carrying warm kolache trays, the scratch-hiss of grandmother''s
  78 RPM Benny Goodman records on the basement Victrola, Tommy Kowalski''s gap-toothed
  Polish curses echoing through St. Adalbert''s pews, Miss Patricia Novak noting complex
  humming during art time at Seward Elementary. Each verse layers specific temporal
  coordinates - radiator percussion through Minneapolis winter nights, brown paper
  bag neighborhood maps, the weight of early responsibility in small hands - creating
  a folk rock requiem for counterfactual nostalgia. The 92 BPM heartbeat matches the
  pace of memory reconstruction, while the D minor tonality captures the bittersweet
  recognition that home was always temporary, that family fractures and heals in patterns
  we only understand decades later. This is the sound of witnessing what never happened
  but feels more real than documented history - the ghost frequency of an erased year
  that continues broadcasting through magnetic tape degradation and quantum timeline
  bleed-through.'
