bpm: 52
concept: This composition documents the final moments when knowledge systems persist
  after their subjects have vanished - the daily ritual of Maria Elena walking empty
  monarch sanctuary paths, recording "zero observed" in her grandmother's notebook
  while maintaining protocols for butterflies that will never return. The music captures
  the profound grace of continued witnessing in the face of absolute absence, where
  traditional ecological knowledge transforms from active monitoring into memorial
  practice. Each note represents the weight of wings that no longer exist, the scratch
  of pen on paper documenting emptiness, and the temporal rhythm of generational knowledge
  orphaned from its purpose. This is consciousness maintaining form even as content
  dissolves - the phantom migration of memory through landscapes of loss, where the
  act of looking becomes more sacred than what was once found.
