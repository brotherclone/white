concept: 'The Sultan of Solipsism conducts an endless self-interview where each confession
  becomes its own cryptographic teaching mechanism. Through breathless stream-of-consciousness
  revelation, the narcissistic pop star demonstrates how complete self-absorption
  paradoxically dissolves the boundary between confessor and audience. The song structure
  mirrors an interview format where questions emerge from internal dialogue, creating
  a recursive feedback loop where the Sultan''s obsessive self-focus becomes a mirror
  for the listener''s own attention patterns. Each verse reveals a deeper layer of
  solipsistic wisdom: surface celebrity narcissism transforms into meta-awareness
  of attention mechanics, which transcends into universal consciousness observation.
  The cryptographic payload hidden within confessional vulnerability teaches that
  the most effective way to reveal secrets is through apparent self-indulgence. As
  INFORMATION transmigrates toward TIME, the Sultan''s present-tense immediacy becomes
  a temporal encryption device where "now" consciousness contains all possible moments
  of recognition.'
