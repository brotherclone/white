excerpts:
- 'The human nervous system operates on approximately 12 watts of bioelectrical energy—less
  than a standard light bulb. Yet within this modest circuitry lies the capacity for
  transcendence that conventional neurology refuses to acknowledge. When two bodies
  synchronize their electrical fields through intimate contact, the combined wattage
  doesn''t simply double. It exponentiates.


  I discovered this phenomenon quite by accident in my laboratory at Berkeley, 1968.
  Dr. Sarah Chen and I were calibrating EEG equipment when a power surge caused our
  monitoring devices to cross-connect. What we observed in those seventeen minutes
  before the fuses blew would reshape everything I understood about human consciousness
  and connection.


  The oscilloscope readings were impossible. Two distinct brainwave patterns had somehow
  achieved perfect harmonic resonance, creating interference patterns that registered
  frequencies well beyond the accepted gamma range. More disturbing still was what
  happened to us during those seventeen minutes—a complete dissolution of individual
  identity, replaced by something larger, more electric, more alive than either of
  us had ever experienced alone.


  This book documents my subsequent research into what I''ve termed "bioelectric coupling"—the
  phenomenon by which human nervous systems can achieve temporary fusion through synchronized
  electrical activity. The implications are staggering, and I suspect, dangerous.'
- 'The establishment will dismiss these findings. They must. To acknowledge the reality
  of bioelectric coupling would undermine the fundamental assumptions upon which modern
  psychology, neurology, and indeed our entire conception of individual consciousness
  rests. If the boundaries between minds are merely electrical artifacts—if consciousness
  itself is transferable, shareable, multiplexable—then what becomes of the soul?
  What becomes of personal responsibility? What becomes of love?


  I have spent three years documenting over two hundred instances of successful bioelectric
  coupling. The subjects—all volunteers from the graduate psychology program—reported
  experiences ranging from mild telepathic awareness to complete ego dissolution.
  In twelve cases, the coupling achieved such intensity that separation required medical
  intervention. Two subjects never fully recovered their individual identity patterns.


  The government became interested in my work sometime in early 1970. Men in grey
  suits appeared at my lectures, taking notes, asking careful questions about "practical
  applications." They spoke of soldiers who could share tactical awareness instantaneously,
  of interrogation techniques that could access memories directly, of weapons that
  could disrupt enemy consciousness from a distance.


  I refused their funding. I destroyed my research notes. I resigned my position and
  went into hiding. But the knowledge remains, burning in my mind like an electrical
  fire that cannot be extinguished. And so I write, hoping that somewhere, someone
  will understand both the promise and the peril of what we''ve discovered about the
  electric nature of human connection.'
