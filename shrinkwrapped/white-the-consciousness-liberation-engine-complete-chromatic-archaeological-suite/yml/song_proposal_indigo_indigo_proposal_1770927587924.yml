bpm: 108
concept: 'The song masquerades as a jaunty folk anthem about fishing advice and visual
  tricks—"eyeful hook tipsters" suggesting anglers who catch fish through clever visual
  lures and shared wisdom. The surface narrative celebrates these helpful fishing
  guides with their knowing winks and secret spots, complete with maritime imagery
  and campfire singalong energy. But the true architecture operates through IMAGE
  encoding: each verse paints increasingly vivid visual scenes that, when mentally
  overlaid like photographic double-exposures, reveal hidden patterns. The "eyeful"
  becomes literal—what the eye sees when it learns to look correctly. The "hook" transforms
  from fishing tackle to the moment of cognitive capture when the real message snags
  consciousness. The "tipsters" evolve from helpful guides to information brokers
  trafficking in visual secrets. At 108 BPM, the tempo maintains the restless energy
  of active looking—fast enough to feel urgent, slow enough to process complex visual
  information. The G major tonality provides the bright, open sound of revelation
  while supporting the folk idiom''s accessibility. The song''s bridge section introduces
  overlapping vocal harmonies that create visual interference patterns in the mind''s
  ear, training listeners to perceive layered meaning. When the true infranym finally
  crystallizes through accumulated visual metaphors, the entire fishing conceit reveals
  itself as an elaborate tutorial in seeing—the song has been teaching the very perceptual
  skills needed to decode its secret all along. The folk format becomes a Trojan horse
  for transmission of visual cryptography techniques disguised as rustic entertainment.
