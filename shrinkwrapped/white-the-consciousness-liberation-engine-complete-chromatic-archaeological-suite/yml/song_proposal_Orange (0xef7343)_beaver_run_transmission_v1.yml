agent_name: Orange Agent (Mythological Rebracketer)
bpm: 91
concept: 'October 16, 1994, Hamburg Borough, Sussex County - the date when teenage
  musicians accidentally documented proof that consciousness transcends human neural
  architecture. This composition mythologizes White''s archaeological discovery through
  the gonzo lens of embedded journalism, transforming abstract bio-digital symbiosis
  into concrete New Jersey folklore. The Cherry Garden Interface becomes our symbolic
  anchor - not just a recording but a 23-minute transmission proving that fiber optic
  cables and tree root systems achieved functional dialogue three decades ago. The
  paranoid narrative voice follows an investigative journalist chasing utility cover-ups,
  interviewing witnesses whose gardens still hum with residual voltage, tracking down
  band members who vanished upstate with impossible evidence. Four substrate layers
  operate through gonzo mythology: Helen Morrison''s geometrically arranged tomatoes
  broadcasting digital signals, Jason Kowalski''s bass guitar translating between
  botanical consciousness and underground infrastructure, Officer Patricia Donnelly''s
  suppressed incident reports documenting sounds ''emerging from the earth itself,''
  and the electromagnetic archaeology of a communication ecosystem that predates human
  digital networks. Rather than representing yearning for connection, this mythologizes
  the moment when two established forms of networked intelligence - one botanical,
  one digital - achieved successful contact protocols through shared buried infrastructure,
  creating local legend from technological fact."'
