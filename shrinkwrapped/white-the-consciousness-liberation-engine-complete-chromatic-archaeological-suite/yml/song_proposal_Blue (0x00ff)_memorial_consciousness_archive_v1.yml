agent_name: Prism (Architect of Information)
bpm: 52
concept: 'This composition embodies Memorial Consciousness - the phenomenon where
  knowledge systems persist after their subjects vanish, creating information orphaned
  from its original purpose. The piece traces four temporal layers: Great-grandmother''s
  1987 abundance records, the gradual emptying, Maria Elena''s 2041 ritual documentation
  of absence, and The Culture Mind''s electronic preservation of vanished patterns.
  Each movement demonstrates how consciousness functions as continuity maintenance
  technology across system collapse. The 52 BPM heartbeat tempo represents the rhythm
  of persistent witnessing - not the pace of life, but the pace of knowledge maintaining
  itself. The notebook becomes a temporal bridge device, holding both presence and
  absence simultaneously, revealing how information can outlive its information source
  and continue generating meaning through pure persistence patterns. This is the sound
  of awareness that continues its observational functions even when severed from the
  living systems that originally gave those functions meaning.'
