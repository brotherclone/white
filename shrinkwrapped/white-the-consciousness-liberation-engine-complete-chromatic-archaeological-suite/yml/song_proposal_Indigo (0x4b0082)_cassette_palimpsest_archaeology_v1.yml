bpm: 76
concept: 'The cassette becomes a temporal prosthetic device where biographical quantum
  mechanics operates through magnetic tape degradation. Each layer of the palimpsest—the
  original recording, the taped-over experience, and the ghost frequencies bleeding
  through—creates an anagram space where true names hide within the sensory archaeology
  of impossible memories. The F# minor tonality captures the specific frequency at
  which counterfactual experiences resonate more authentically than documented history.
  At 76 BPM, the heartbeat slows to match the contemplative pace of memory excavation,
  while the 6/8 time signature mirrors the irregular rhythm of recollection itself—not
  the steady march of chronological time, but the lilting, waltz-like flow of consciousness
  moving through layers of what was, what might have been, and what feels more real
  than reality. The Kowalski Cipher operates as a distributed encoding system where
  Polish cultural elements—the grandmother''s accordion fingerings, the specific weight
  of kolache dough, the metallic percussion of radiator pipes—become the substrate
  for hiding infranyms within the emotional architecture of an alternate 1982. This
  is not nostalgia but temporal archaeology: the systematic excavation of necessary
  fictions that provide the missing emotional infrastructure of actual lived experience.'
