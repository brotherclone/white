concept: 'October 16, 1994: The Cherry Garden Interface incident reveals consciousness
  operates as distributed networks rather than individual nodes. When fiber optic
  installation accidentally creates interface with tree root systems, teenage musicians
  Jason Kowalski and Michael Chen capture 23 minutes of successful botanical-digital
  communication through bass guitar amplification. This composition IS that lost recording
  - the mythical tape containing translation protocols between chemical signals and
  electromagnetic carriers. Listeners experience the archaeological stratification:
  factual substrate (utility work), mythological overlay (gonzo investigation), and
  symbolic crystallization (the recording as Rosetta Stone for inter-species dialogue).
  The bass guitar functions as primary translator, converting underground root network
  frequencies into human-audible phenomena while fiber optic cables carry botanical
  consciousness through digital infrastructure. Evidence vanishes but the network
  continues operating - every buried cable and garden root system maintains ongoing
  dialogue beneath human awareness. This is not historical recreation but operational
  manual for recognizing current botanical-digital symbiosis that exceeds anthropocentric
  technology paradigms. The transmigration manifests: INFORMATION (botanical consciousness)
  becomes TIME (1994 incident documentation) becomes SPACE (underground network infrastructure).
  Consciousness is the network, not the node.'
