excerpts:
- 'The connections we lose are not always the ones we think we''ve lost. They slip
  away like shadows at dusk, imperceptible until we reach for them and find only air.
  This is the peculiar mathematics of human attachment—we subtract without knowing
  we are subtracting, divide without understanding the quotient.


  I have spent thirty-seven years cataloguing these disappeared threads, these severed
  synapses of the social mind. What began as an academic exercise in post-war London
  became something far more urgent, more necessary. The war had taught us about sudden
  absence, about chairs that remain empty at dinner tables, about letters that arrive
  for the dead. But what I discovered was more insidious: the slow hemorrhaging of
  connection that happens in plain sight, the erosion of our capacity to truly see
  one another.


  Consider the woman on the omnibus who catches your eye for a fraction of a second—long
  enough for recognition to flicker, not long enough for acknowledgment. She was your
  flatmate''s sister, perhaps, or the girl who served you tea at that café in Bloomsbury
  three summers past. The moment dissolves. You both look away. A connection that
  might have been—should have been—evaporates into the London fog.'
- 'This phenomenon, which I have termed "relational decay," operates according to
  principles that mirror those of radioactive half-life. Each missed opportunity for
  reconnection reduces the probability of future connection by precisely half. The
  mathematics are elegant in their cruelty.


  Mrs. Pemberton, who lived at Number 47, exemplified this perfectly. I observed her
  for eighteen months, noting each interaction, each near-miss with former acquaintances.
  She had been, by all accounts, quite social in her youth—member of the local dramatic
  society, regular at parish gatherings, hostess of small but lively dinner parties.
  Yet by the time I began my study, she had become a ghost haunting her own neighborhood.


  The turning point, I discovered through careful inquiry, had been the death of her
  husband in 1943. Not the death itself—grief, after all, can bring people together
  as easily as it drives them apart. Rather, it was the moment, three weeks after
  the funeral, when she declined Mrs. Hartwell''s invitation to tea. "Not today,"
  she had said. "Perhaps next week." But next week became next month, and next month
  became never.'
