  what_changed: Gabriel's parents separated temporarily, and instead of staying with
    his mother in their family home, he was sent to live with his paternal grandmother
    Margaret Walsh in Minneapolis while his mother found work and a new apartment
  when: January 1982
  why_plausible: Family separations often involve children staying with grandparents
    for stability, and Minneapolis had a large Polish-American community where such
    arrangements were common in working-class families during the early 1980s economic
    recession

mood_description: The weight of warm bread in small hands. The percussion of old radiators
  through Minneapolis winter nights. The scratch and hiss of 78 RPM records spinning
  stories of a world before television. A seven-year-old learning that home could
  be temporary, that family could fracture and heal, that music lived in the walls
  of places and seeped into dreams. The melancholy of early responsibility mixed with
  the wonder of discovering that adults' lives were more fragile and complex than
  he had imagined.
narrative: 'The cassette hisses with the ghost of another winter. In this timeline,
  seven-year-old Gabriel spent 1982 not in his suburban home but in the narrow apartment
  above Kowalski''s Bakery on Cedar Avenue in Minneapolis, where his grandmother Margaret
  Walsh had lived since 1956.


  The smell never left his clothes - yeast and flour, the sweet burn of ovens firing
  at 4 AM. Mrs. Eleanor Kowalski, a seventy-three-year-old Polish woman with forearms
  like a longshoreman, would knock on the thin wall between the bakery and the apartment
  stairs every morning at 5:30. "Gabriel! Come help with the kolache!"


  His grandmother Margaret, sixty-eight and arthritic, moved slowly through the two-bedroom
  apartment that smelled of Bengay and instant coffee. She had raised four sons in
  that space, including Gabriel''s father, and the walls still held the accumulated
  weight of decades of family meals, arguments, and reconciliations.


  Gabriel learned to carry trays of fresh bread to the front counter, his small hands
  gripping the metal edges while steam rose from the loaves. Tommy Kowalski, Mrs.
  Kowalski''s grandson who was nine and gap-toothed, taught him Polish swear words
  that made the old ladies at St. Adalbert''s Catholic Church gasp when Gabriel innocently
  repeated them during Sunday mass.


  The apartment had no cable television, just an old Zenith with rabbit ears that
  pulled in three channels on good days. Gabriel spent afternoons in the basement,
  where his grandmother kept boxes of 78 RPM records - Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller,
  Polish polkas with accordion and clarinet. He would wind the old Victrola and listen
  to the scratchy music while drawing elaborate maps of the neighborhood on brown
  paper bags.


  At Seward Elementary School on 28th Avenue, Gabriel was "the bakery boy," always
  carrying the lingering scent of cinnamon and caraway seeds. His teacher, Miss Patricia
  Novak, was young and earnest, fresh from the University of Minnesota. She noticed
  how he would hum complex melodies during art time - not children''s songs, but something
  older, more intricate.


  Winter in Minneapolis that year was brutal. The apartment''s radiators clanked and
  hissed, and Gabriel would press his face to the frost-covered windows to watch the
  early morning bread delivery trucks navigate the icy streets. His grandmother would
  tell him stories about his grandfather Joseph, who had died in 1974, how he had
  worked the night shift at the Ford plant in St. Paul and still found energy to play
  accordion at Polish weddings on weekends.


  By spring, Gabriel had developed a routine: wake at 5:15 to help in the bakery,
  school from 8 to 3, afternoons exploring the neighborhood - Riverside Park where
  the Mississippi curved, the old Carnegie Library on Franklin Avenue, the record
  store on Cedar where the owner, a bearded man named Dave Pirner''s older brother,
  would let him listen to albums on the headphones.


  His parents visited every other Sunday. His mother, Linda, looked tired and thin,
  working two jobs while living in a studio apartment in Bloomington. His father,
  Patrick, seemed smaller somehow, diminished by the separation and the cramped quarters
  of his bachelor pad near the university.


  The reconciliation came in December, just before Christmas. Gabriel was in the basement,
  listening to a scratchy recording of "In the Mood" when his parents appeared at
  the top of the stairs together, holding hands tentatively. The move back home happened
  quickly - three garbage bags of clothes, his collection of hand-drawn maps, and
  a small accordion his grandmother had bought him at a pawn shop on Lake Street.


  But something had shifted. Gabriel carried the rhythm of the bakery in his bones
  now - the 4 AM stirring, the communion of shared work, the way music could live
  in the walls of a place and seep into your dreams. He never forgot the weight of
  warm bread in his small hands, or how his grandmother''s voice sounded when she
  sang Polish lullabies while the radiators knocked out their metallic percussion
  through the long Minneapolis nights.'
