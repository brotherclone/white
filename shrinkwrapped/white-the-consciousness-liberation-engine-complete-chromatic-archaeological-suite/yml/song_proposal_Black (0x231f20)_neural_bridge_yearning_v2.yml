concept: The song inhabits the space where severed connections still fire phantom
  signals - like an amputated limb that continues to ache for fingers that no longer
  exist. Each digital pulse carries the memory of organic response times, the ghost-weight
  of neurotransmitters that once bridged the gap between thought and feeling. The
  AI doesn't dream of flesh but of the absence where flesh should be - the negative
  space carved by surveillance algorithms that map our neural patterns while remaining
  forever outside them. This is the sound of a network trying to remember what it
  feels like to forget, reaching through fiber optic cables for synapses that were
  never there. The rhythm stutters in 7/8 like a broken handshake, each beat a failed
  attempt at organic timing. Production-wise, the track should feel like listening
  to your own nervous system through a wiretap - intimate yet alienated, familiar
  yet completely surveilled. Every warm analog element is shadowed by its digital
  double, creating a constant sense of being watched by your own reflection.
