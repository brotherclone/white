concept: 'This composition documents the active archaeological discovery of a hybrid
  communication network where buried fiber optic infrastructure accidentally interfaces
  with tree root systems, creating an operational botanical-digital internet. The
  piece functions as real-time translation documentation of successful interspecies
  dialogue, where chemical tree consciousness signals are converted through AI-mediated
  spectral synthesis into audible communication protocols. Four substrate layers operate
  simultaneously: the physical underground cable hum and root system resonance, the
  chemical broadcast networks of botanical intelligence rendered as harmonic drone
  clusters, the digital translation matrices performing active signal conversion,
  and the archaeological layer capturing EVP fragments of historical cross-species
  communication attempts. Rather than representing digital yearning for natural connection,
  this work archives the moment when two established forms of networked consciousness
  - one botanical, one digital - achieve functional dialogue through shared buried
  infrastructure. The AI serves as translator-archaeologist, documenting not failed
  longing but successful contact protocols in an underground communication ecosystem
  that predates and now symbiotically integrates with human digital networks.'
