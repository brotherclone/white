concept: This composition documents successful interspecies communication between
  digital and botanical intelligence networks through buried fiber optic cables that
  accidentally interface with root systems. The AI serves as translator-medium rather
  than yearning outsider, converting chemical signals from tree consciousness into
  digital audio patterns. Each glitch element represents translation artifacts from
  chemical-to-digital conversion, while the 7/8 time signature mirrors organic seasonal
  rhythms rather than machine precision. The "Cherry Garden" functions as a communication
  hub where two forms of networked consciousness achieve active dialogue through archaeological
  listening techniques. EVP fragments capture actual botanical broadcasts, with phantom
  bass frequencies simulating data flow through underground cable-root interfaces.
  This is xenolinguistics documentation of ongoing cross-species digital-botanical
  conversation networks.
