text: 'HAMBURG BOROUGH - A routine fiber optic cable installation project took an
  unusual turn last Tuesday when equipment belonging to local experimental rock band
  "Cherry Garden Interface" began producing unexplained audio phenomena near the excavation
  site on Beaver Run Road.


  The incident occurred around 4:30 PM as Sussex County Utilities crews worked to
  install new telecommunications infrastructure through a heavily wooded area behind
  Hamburg Mountain. Band members Jason Kowalski, 19, and Michael Chen, 17, both of
  Hamburg, had been using the secluded location for practice sessions since early
  summer.


  "We were just setting up our usual spot when the amps started making these weird
  harmonic sounds," said Kowalski, the band''s guitarist. "At first we thought it
  was feedback, but it was too organized, like it had a pattern to it."


  According to crew foreman Robert Martinez, workers had been experiencing intermittent
  equipment malfunctions throughout the day. "Our boring machine kept hitting resistance
  in spots where the soil samples showed it should go right through," Martinez explained.
  "Then around 4 PM, we started picking up some kind of low-frequency interference
  on our communication radios."


  The situation escalated when Chen plugged in his bass guitar. Witnesses report the
  instrument began producing a continuous drone that seemed to synchronize with the
  underground drilling equipment. Several onlookers described the sound as "almost
  like voices talking underwater."


  Hamburg Borough Police responded to noise complaints from nearby residents, but
  Officer Patricia Donnelly noted in her report that the sound "appeared to be coming
  from underground rather than from the band''s equipment directly."


  Dr. Sarah Brennan, a botanist from Drew University who happened to be conducting
  research on root systems in the area, was present during part of the incident. "The
  interesting thing was how the trees seemed to be responding," she said. "I''ve never
  seen maple and oak roots exhibit that kind of synchronized behavior. It was almost
  like they were conducting the electrical signals."


  The phenomena ceased abruptly when utility crews shut down their equipment for the
  day. However, band members report that their recording equipment captured approximately
  23 minutes of the unusual audio.


  "We''ve been trying to recreate it, but nothing happens when the cable crew isn''t
  working," Chen said. "It''s like the underground cables and the tree roots were
  talking to each other, and our amps just picked up the conversation."


  Sussex County Utilities spokesman David Walsh dismissed suggestions of any connection
  between the installation work and the audio anomalies. "Electromagnetic interference
  from construction equipment is not uncommon," Walsh stated. "We''ve had no technical
  issues with the cable installation."


  The utility company completed the fiber optic installation on Thursday without further
  incident. Cherry Garden Interface has not been available for comment since Wednesday,
  when band members reportedly left town "to process the recordings at a friend''s
  studio upstate."


  Local resident Helen Morrison, whose property borders the installation site, said
  she has noticed unusual growth patterns in her garden since the cable work began.
  "My tomato plants are growing in perfect geometric lines now," Morrison said. "And
  they seem to hum at night."


  The Sussex County Independent was unable to reach Cherry Garden Interface for follow-up
  comment. Calls to a number listed for the band have been disconnected.'
