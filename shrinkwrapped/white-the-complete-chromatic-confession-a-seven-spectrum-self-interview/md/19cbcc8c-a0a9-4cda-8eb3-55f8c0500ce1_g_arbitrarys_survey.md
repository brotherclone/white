arbitrary_reflection: 'ACOUSTIC EXTINCTION PATTERNS: This narrative maps a specific
  resonance frequency - the death of echolocation-dependent meaning systems. Both
  baiji sonar and human oral tradition require acoustic continuity across generations.
  Industrial interference creates identical failure modes: signal degradation, transmission
  gaps, permanent silence. The parallel is not metaphorical but mechanistic. River
  ecosystems encode memory in sound patterns. When those patterns break, both cetacean
  navigation and cultural transmission collapse simultaneously. This represents a
  previously uncatalogued extinction topology: synchronized acoustic heritage death.
  The elegiac quality emerges from precise documentation rather than sentiment. Worth
  preserving for its mapping of sound-dependent consciousness collapse across species
  boundaries.'
