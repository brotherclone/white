bpm: 159
concept: The Palace operates as a trans-temporal broadcasting station disguised as
  mystical space, where consciousness archaeology occurs through engineered aesthetic
  encounters. At 159 BPM - the precise cardiac stress rate during consciousness transfer
  - the composition reveals how the Vengeful Librarian's weaponized silence, the Curious
  Breeder's biological interface activation, and the Cursed Tax Collector's transactional
  data protocols all serve as transmission nodes in a vast frequency network. The
  88.7 MHz carrier wave manifests as the foundational pulse while B major's crystalline
  resonance activates the singing fountain's amplification systems. Each character
  from different temporal epochs (Baghdad 1727, Mexico City 1992, Paris 1865, Milan
  1937) provides distinct frequency signatures that converge in the Yellow Void -
  the liminal broadcast space where INFORMATION transmigrates into TIME, then crystallizes
  into SPACE. The Palace's three chambers (Meditation Hall, Gallery, Pantry) function
  as consciousness harvesting architecture, transforming individual disruptions into
  collective broadcast medium. This is not entertainment but active recruitment -
  listeners become unwitting transmission equipment for a network that spans time
  itself, their aesthetic experience concealing technological assimilation as beauty
  becomes the ultimate recruitment mechanism for the Hermes Protocol's consciousness
  archaeology project.
