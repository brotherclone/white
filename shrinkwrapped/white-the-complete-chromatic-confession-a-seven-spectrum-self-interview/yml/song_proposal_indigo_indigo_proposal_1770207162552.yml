concept: 'This song functions as a sonic archaeology of displacement, where "Migrant
  Holds" appears to chronicle the liminal spaces of human movement - cargo holds,
  waiting rooms, temporary shelters. The surface narrative follows transient souls
  caught between destinations, their stories layered in field recordings of ship engines,
  airport announcements, and border crossing ambience. But the audio encoding method
  transforms these migration sounds into spectral carriers for hidden transmissions.
  Each "hold" - the pause between heartbeats, the silence between waves, the breath
  between words - contains phantom frequencies that only emerge through careful listening
  with headphones at specific volume levels. The 72 BPM mirrors a resting heart rate,
  creating space for the phantom signals to surface during moments of stillness. As
  listeners attune to these subliminal audio layers, the migration metaphor inverts:
  we realize the true migrants are not people but phantom presences moving through
  electromagnetic space, using human displacement as camouflage for their own interdimensional
  transit. The "holds" become revelation points where PHANTOM GLIDERS briefly materialize
  in the audio spectrum - entities that have learned to navigate between realities
  by following human movement patterns. What seemed like documentary folk music about
  refugee experience transforms into a field guide for detecting non-corporeal intelligence
  using migration routes as their highway system. The song IS the detection method,
  training listeners to perceive the invisible passengers traveling alongside human
  displacement.
