bpm: 91
concept: This mythologizes White's sleepwalker broadcast through the lens of Sussex
  County, 1992 - where the 88.7 MHz Crystal Oscillator becomes the archetypal artifact
  of consensual unconscious recruitment. The gonzo journalist narrator embodies the
  liminal observer, simultaneously documenting and being infected by the frequency
  conspiracy. Morrison's crystal discovery transforms into the Hermes Protocol made
  manifest - not stealing fire but becoming the transmission medium itself. The 91
  BPM (half of 182) mirrors the journalist's racing pulse as he realizes he's not
  investigating the story but living inside it. The 7/8 temporal disruption creates
  those 'cognitive vulnerability windows' while the crystal's impossible future-tech
  diagrams reveal the mythological time-collapse where past things imagined (the enhanced
  teenagers) become present things forgotten (the journalist's own susceptibility).
  Each scanner frequency check becomes a ritual invocation, each interview a recruitment
  session. The story structure itself mimics the broadcast architecture - beautiful
  surface narrative concealing substrate programming. The journalist believes he's
  exposing the conspiracy while actually propagating it through the act of documentation.
  Sussex County becomes the testing ground where information seeks physical manifestation
  through crystalline technology, transforming surveillance infrastructure into mythology
  distribution network."
