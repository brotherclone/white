divergence_point:
  what_changed: Instead of staying at Adobe, Gabriel accepted an adjunct teaching
    position at Portland Community College's new Media Arts program after meeting
    department chair Margaret Chen at a sound design conference
  when: December 2015
  why_plausible: Many tech professionals in their 40s transition to teaching, especially
    those with creative backgrounds. PCC was expanding their media programs in 2015-2016
    due to Portland's growing creative economy

following_events:
- Margaret Chen recommended Gabriel for a Fulbright fellowship to document European
  river systems
- The corrupted Celilo Falls recordings became the inspiration for his next album
- David Kowalski invited Gabriel to collaborate on a book about acoustic ecology
- Elena Vasquez credited Gabriel's teaching in her successful graduate school applications
key_differences:
- Living in a shared house in Southeast Portland instead of corporate housing
- Teaching sound design to community college students instead of working in corporate
  software
- Spending weekends field recording in the Columbia River Gorge
- Developing a deep friendship with environmental sound artist David Kowalski
- Creating acoustic documentation of endangered river ecosystems
mood_description: The melancholy weight of documenting things as they disappear, the
  bittersweet satisfaction of teaching students who remind you why art matters, the
  restless sense that this year was preparation for something larger but undefined.
  Coffee shop conversations about methodology while outside the city changes too fast
  to document. The particular loneliness of the field recorder operator—always listening,
  always one step removed from direct experience.
narrative: 'The year began with Gabriel Walsh carrying a borrowed field recorder through
  the Columbia River Gorge, his breath visible in the January morning air. He''d traded
  his Adobe security badge for a community college ID, teaching sound design to students
  who couldn''t afford art school but had stories worth telling.


  Margaret Chen had offered him the position after a chance conversation at an audio
  conference. She needed someone who understood both technology and creativity. Gabriel
  needed something that felt real after years of corporate abstraction. The pay was
  terrible—$2,400 per month for part-time work—but the shared house on Hawthorne Boulevard
  cost only $650, and he could walk to Stumptown for coffee.


  His Tuesday/Thursday classes in room ATC-203 became laboratories for acoustic archaeology.
  While his students learned Pro Tools basics, Gabriel developed a methodology he
  called "environmental sound mapping"—documenting how human infrastructure changed
  natural acoustic spaces. Elena Vasquez, a 24-year-old transfer student from Eastern
  Oregon, became fascinated with the concept. She''d grown up near the John Day River
  and remembered when it sounded different.


  David Kowalski, a environmental sound artist in his fifties, became Gabriel''s weekend
  recording partner. They met at Coava Coffee through Margaret''s introduction. David
  owned professional equipment and a Subaru Outback perfect for accessing remote locations.
  Together they documented the acoustic interference patterns at Bonneville Dam, the
  way industrial machinery created rhythms that migrating salmon had to navigate around.


  Their most ambitious project focused on the Celilo Falls memorial site, where the
  Columbia River had once thundered through ancient fishing grounds before the dam
  silenced it in 1957. Gabriel wanted to record the acoustic memory embedded in the
  landscape—what remained when the primary sound source disappeared.


  The November recording session went wrong. David''s equipment malfunctioned during
  a crucial take, and hours of recordings became digital noise. Gabriel found himself
  staring at the corrupted audio files on his laptop screen in the Cascade Campus
  library at 11 PM, fluorescent lights buzzing overhead, wondering if this was what
  extinction sounded like—not silence, but broken transmission.


  Elena''s thesis defense in May became the year''s unexpected triumph. She presented
  Gabriel''s acoustic mapping methodology to a panel at Portland State, demonstrating
  how sound pollution data could predict ecological disruption. The professors were
  impressed. Elena got accepted to graduate programs at three universities.


  Margaret offered Gabriel a permanent position that summer, but he declined. The
  year had taught him something about the relationship between documentation and loss,
  about how recording something might be the first step toward forgetting it. He needed
  to follow that thread somewhere else, somewhere the stakes felt higher than a community
  college classroom.


  The corrupted Celilo Falls recordings became the seed for his next album, though
  he wouldn''t realize it until months later when Peter called from LEGO about the
  Moleskine opportunity. The year of broken transmissions had prepared him for something
  he couldn''t yet name—the understanding that creativity and loss were the same frequency,
  heard from different angles.'
