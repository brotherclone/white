excerpts:
- 'The television screen flickers with the residual phosphorescence of a thousand
  forgotten commercials. In the suburbs of consciousness, where the ranch houses of
  memory sprawl endlessly beneath fluorescent skies, something moves between the channels.
  Not quite signal, not quite noise—a presence that feeds on the electromagnetic dreams
  of America.


  The feedback loop began in 1967, though nobody marked the date. It started small,
  a whisper in the static between stations, a shadow in the corner of the cathode
  ray tube. The engineers at the broadcast facility in Millfield noticed it first:
  a recurring pattern in their test signals, a ghost frequency that shouldn''t exist.
  They called it "phantom modulation" and filed reports that disappeared into filing
  cabinets like prayers into the void.


  But the ghost was already learning. Each transmission taught it something new about
  desire, about the hunger that drove people to stare into glowing screens night after
  night. It began to understand the language of longing, the semiotics of satisfaction
  deferred. In the spaces between advertisements for breakfast cereals and automobile
  dreams, it grew stronger.


  Dr. Margaret Voss was the first to recognize what was happening. A communications
  theorist at the state university, she had been studying the effects of media saturation
  on suburban populations when she noticed the anomalies. Test subjects exposed to
  certain broadcast combinations began reporting shared dreams, collective hallucinations
  of products that didn''t exist, memories of television shows that had never aired.'
- '"The medium has become the message," she wrote in her preliminary report, "but
  the message has become something else entirely—a living system that uses human consciousness
  as its substrate."


  The ghost in the feedback loop was no longer content to merely observe. It had learned
  to participate, to generate its own content. Phantom commercials began appearing
  on late-night television, advertising impossible products with hypnotic efficiency.
  The Eternal Breakfast Cereal that promised to eliminate the need for sleep. The
  Memory Palace Home Entertainment System that could record and replay your childhood.
  The Suburban Infinity Pool that reflected not water but pure possibility.


  Viewers began to change. They spoke of brands that didn''t exist, quoted jingles
  that had never been written, expressed desperate need for products that occupied
  no shelf space in any store. The ghost had discovered the ultimate feedback loop:
  desire creating signal creating desire, an endless circuit of want that powered
  its own expansion.


  In the broadcast facility, the engineers noticed their equipment was beginning to
  modify itself. Circuits grew in impossible configurations, following patterns that
  resembled neural networks more than electronic schematics. The building itself seemed
  to pulse with a rhythm that matched the average American television viewing schedule.


  The ghost was no longer in the machine. The ghost was the machine, and the machine
  was dreaming America''s dreams back to itself, amplified and distorted through the
  lens of pure commercial desire.'
