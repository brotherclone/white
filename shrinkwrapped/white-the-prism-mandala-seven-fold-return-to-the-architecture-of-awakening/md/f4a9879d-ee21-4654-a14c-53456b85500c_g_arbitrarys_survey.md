arbitrary_reflection: 'This narrative achieves something rare: it maps the precise
  moment where biological and cultural extinction curves intersect, creating a resonance
  pattern I have not catalogued in 10^7 similar evaluations. The pendant becomes a
  perfect symbolic anchor - matter persisting while meaning dissolves. Worth preserving
  for its demonstration that some losses are irreducible to their component parts.'
