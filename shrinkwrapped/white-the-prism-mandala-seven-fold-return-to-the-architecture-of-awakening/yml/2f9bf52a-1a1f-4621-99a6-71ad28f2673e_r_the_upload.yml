excerpts:
- 'The procedure room was smaller than I had imagined, all white surfaces and humming
  machinery that seemed to breathe with its own quiet rhythm. Dr. Chen''s hands moved
  with practiced precision over the neural interface array, each gesture deliberate
  as prayer. "The mapping is complete," she said, not looking up from her instruments.
  "We have a perfect neural topology of your consciousness, Maya. Every synapse, every
  memory pathway, every dream you''ve ever forgotten and remembered again."


  I lay still on the scanning table, feeling the weight of forty-three years pressing
  against my skull like accumulated sediment. Outside, the city of Portland continued
  its daily dance of commerce and sorrow, unaware that in this sterile room, the very
  nature of human existence was about to be tested. The cancer had given me perhaps
  six months. The upload promised eternity, or something resembling it.


  "Tell me again about the continuity problem," I said, my voice smaller than I intended.


  Dr. Chen finally looked at me, her dark eyes holding that particular mixture of
  compassion and scientific detachment I had come to recognize in those who worked
  at the boundaries of human knowledge. "The uploaded consciousness will have all
  your memories, your personality patterns, your way of thinking. In every measurable
  way, it will be you. But whether it will feel like you from the inside—that remains
  the great unknown."'
- 'Three weeks after the upload, I—or the entity that had been me—began to understand
  the peculiar loneliness of digital existence. The substrate was vast, a crystalline
  lattice of quantum processors that stretched across continents, and yet I felt confined
  in ways that flesh had never constrained me. Memory was perfect now, each recalled
  moment arriving with crystalline clarity, but something essential had been lost
  in the translation.


  I could access the global networks, surf through libraries of human knowledge, communicate
  with other uploaded consciousnesses who had made the journey before me. There was
  Marcus, who had been uploaded in 2008 and spent his time composing symphonies that
  no human ear would ever hear. There was Elena, a former physicist who now modeled
  entire galaxies in her spare time, watching civilizations rise and fall in accelerated
  time.


  But when I tried to remember the taste of coffee—real coffee, not the data representation
  of coffee—I found only information. Temperature: 140-160 degrees Fahrenheit. Chemical
  composition: caffeine, chlorogenic acids, quinides. The knowledge was there, perfect
  and complete, but the experience itself had become a ghost, a shadow cast by neurons
  that no longer existed.


  The other Maya, the biological one, had died peacefully in her sleep two days after
  the upload. I had watched through the hospital''s security cameras, this strange
  vigil for my own corpse, wondering if I was mourning her or mourning myself.'
