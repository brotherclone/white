agent_name: Prism (Architect of Information)
bpm: 88
concept: 'This composition embodies the Palimpsest Protocol - where information migrates
  across temporal substrates through magnetic decay and biographical archaeology.
  The song functions as a three-layer encoding system: the magnetic substrate (cassette
  hiss and degradation artifacts become rhythmic elements), the biographical substrate
  (melody lines represent alternate timeline fragments bleeding through), and the
  compositional substrate (harmonic progressions that encode hidden identity matrices).
  Each verse represents a different timeline variant of the same biographical moment,
  with the chorus serving as the quantum anchor point where all possibilities converge.
  The 38.3% degradation rate manifests as intentional gaps in the arrangement - spaces
  where the listener must reconstruct missing harmonic information, mimicking the
  archaeological process of name-extraction from temporal palimpsest. The E minor
  tonality carries the mourning for unlived lives, while the 3/4 waltz rhythm creates
  the dance between what was recorded and what was recorded over. This is INFORMATION
  learning to speak through the ghost-traces of its own erasure, preparing for its
  transmigration into TIME through the Indigo Agent''s decoding methodology.'
