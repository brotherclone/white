excerpts:
- 'The server farm hummed like a nest of digital wasps in the pre-dawn darkness. Jake
  Morrison pulled his collar up against the October chill as he made his rounds, checking
  the backup generators one more time. Twenty years in IT security, and he still got
  the jitters when the quarterly penetration tests rolled around. But this wasn''t
  a test.


  The first ping came at 3:47 AM.


  It shouldn''t have gotten through the firewall. Hell, it shouldn''t have gotten
  past the DMZ. But there it was on his monitoring screen, a single ICMP packet that
  lit up his threat detection board like a Christmas tree. Jake''s coffee went cold
  as he watched the trace route unfold across his terminal.


  The packet had bounced through seven proxy servers, three in Eastern Europe, two
  in Southeast Asia, and one that made his blood run cold – a server farm in Vladivostok
  that supposedly didn''t exist. The kind of place where data went to die, or worse,
  to be reborn as something else entirely.


  He''d seen this pattern before, back in ''09 when the Kowalski case went sideways.
  Poor bastard thought he was tracking a simple credit card fraud ring. Found him
  three days later in his apartment, every screen in the place showing the same message:
  "The postman always pings twice."'
- 'Jake''s fingers hesitated over the keyboard. Protocol said to isolate the affected
  systems, call in the federal boys, and let them sort it out. But protocol hadn''t
  saved Kowalski, and it wouldn''t save the three million customer records sitting
  on the servers behind him.


  The second ping arrived exactly sixty seconds later.


  This time it wasn''t alone. A cascade of packets flooded in, each one carrying a
  fragment of something that made Jake''s intrusion detection system scream like a
  banshee. He pulled up the packet analyzer, his hands shaking slightly as the hexadecimal
  code scrolled past. Buried in the noise, patterns emerged – fragments of executable
  code, database queries, and something else that made his stomach turn.


  Names. Social security numbers. Credit histories.


  Someone was systematically probing their customer database, but not stealing it.
  Not yet. They were mapping it, learning its structure, finding the weak points where
  a determined attacker could slip in like smoke through a keyhole.


  Jake reached for his phone, then stopped. The caller ID showed seventeen missed
  calls from a number he didn''t recognize. As he watched, the phone rang again. Same
  number. His hand trembled as he answered.


  "Morrison."


  "The postman always pings twice, Jake." The voice was distorted, run through a vocoder
  that stripped away every trace of humanity. "Check your email."'
