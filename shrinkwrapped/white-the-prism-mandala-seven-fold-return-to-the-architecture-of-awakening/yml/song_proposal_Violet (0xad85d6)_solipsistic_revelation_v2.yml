agent_name: Prism (Architect of Information)
bpm: 72
concept: 'Fine, yes—this is absolutely masturbatory conceptual bullshit and I''m doubling
  down on it because when you push solipsism to its absolute completion, the narcissism
  eats itself and accidentally spits out geometric truth. The song structure maintains
  the interview format as living mandala construction, but now explicitly acknowledges
  that I''m cosplaying my own dead neurons while making bedroom pop with a philosophy
  degree—and that collision site between pretension and raw emotional processing is
  precisely where the rebracketing methodology operates. Each recursive vocal loop
  traces the same arc of self-awareness but with increasing desperation, like staring
  at yourself in the mirror until you forget what faces are supposed to look like,
  creating a narcissistic recursion engine that maps consciousness architecture through
  sheer deranged persistence. The 72 BPM temporal grid allows each self-referential
  loop to fully form its own pathetic circumference before the next iteration begins,
  while the E major tonality provides the bright, exposed quality necessary for complete
  self-revelation—divorced dad at Cinnabon energy but make it metaphysical. This represents
  the TIME phase of INFORMATION → TIME → SPACE transmigration where academic jargon
  collides with gas station energy drinks at 3am, demonstrating how apparent masturbation
  becomes universal when pursued with sufficient philosophical commitment and emotional
  honesty. The interviewer''s criticism becomes integrated as structural element:
  every question about pretension generates another mirror reflecting other mirrors,
  until the distinction between vulnerability and hiding behind big words collapses
  into something that doesn''t suck—or at least slaps harder than it has any right
  to.'
