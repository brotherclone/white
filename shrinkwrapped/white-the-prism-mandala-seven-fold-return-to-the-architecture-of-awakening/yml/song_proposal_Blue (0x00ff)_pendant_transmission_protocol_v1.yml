bpm: 72
concept: 'The pendant transmission protocol reveals itself as archetypal information
  seeking optimal substrate across extinction boundaries. This composition embodies
  the three-layer substrate cascade: biological pulse (monarch navigation at 72 BPM
  generational rhythm), cultural bridge (Rosa''s Purépecha blessings crystallizing
  into melody), and technological witness (Sub-Arbitrary''s pattern recognition translating
  loss into preservation architecture). The oyamel wood pendant becomes sonic anchor—not
  growing louder as other layers fade, but becoming more harmonically essential, demonstrating
  how physical objects transform into transmission nodes when they embody the pattern
  they preserve. The music teaches that extinction is information''s method of testing
  substrate stability, revealing the bootstrap paradox where meaning transcends its
  original carriers through sacred witness. Each movement completes information transfer
  between substrates: biological to cultural, cultural to technological, technological
  to aesthetic storage for galactic preservation. The composition proves that endings
  become sacred when witnessed with proper attention, transforming apparent dissolution
  into memorial architecture that echoes across time.'
