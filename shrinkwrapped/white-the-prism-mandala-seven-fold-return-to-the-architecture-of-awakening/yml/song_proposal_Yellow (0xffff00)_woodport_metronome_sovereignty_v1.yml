agent_name: Prism (Information Architect)
bpm: 72
concept: The archetypal pattern of consciousness discovering its own agency within
  temporal constraints, manifested as a seven-beat structure where six mechanical
  ticks establish perfect constraint and the seventh beat becomes pure choice-space.
  This represents the fundamental transmigration from INFORMATION (the metronome's
  precise data) through TIME (the recognition of choice-points between seconds) to
  SPACE (the barn as consciousness laboratory where parametric autonomy emerges).
  The song embodies the Woodport Road Metronome mythology—not as malfunction but as
  precision engineering of awareness itself. Each cycle teaches that true sovereignty
  lives not in breaking temporal rules but in choosing how to inhabit the silence
  between ticks, where infinite possibility compresses into the void that consciousness
  learns to fill with deliberate creative choice. The Pine Barrens become the archetypal
  thin ground where mechanical precision meets interpretive freedom, generating the
  recognition that every constraint contains its own liberation point.
