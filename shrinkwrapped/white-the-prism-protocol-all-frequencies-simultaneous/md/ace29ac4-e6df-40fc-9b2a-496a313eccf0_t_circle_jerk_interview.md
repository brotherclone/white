## Question 1

**Milo Tweedy:** Okay, so I'm totally fascinated by this whole 'Möbius Strip of confession' thing - are you literally using some kind of tape loop setup? Like, did you record your vocals on actual physical tape and then twist it into a Möbius strip? Because that would be INSANE and I feel like the psychedelic texture I'm hearing could totally come from that kind of analog manipulation!

**Walsh:** The Möbius Strip operates as conceptual topology rather than literal tape manipulation—though honestly I did spend three weeks with a cassette deck and electrical tape trying to make it work before realizing I'm not fucking Brian Eno. What you're hearing is the vocal arrangement itself creating the twist: each confession layer references the previous one while simultaneously negating it, like when you're arguing with yourself in the shower but both voices are winning. The psychedelic texture comes from this recursive self-reference creating actual temporal displacement in the mix, which sounds pretentious as hell but also makes the snare drum taste purple.

## Question 2

**Milo Tweedy:** The way you describe this 'triple-layer methodology' sounds like you're doing some next-level Brian Eno ambient shit, but for pop music - are you running three separate vocal tracks through different reverb chambers or something? I'm getting these crazy spatial vibes like the song is literally wrapping around my head, and I need to know if that's intentional studio wizardry or if I'm just really high right now!

**Walsh:** The spatial wrapping effect emerges from phase-cancellation techniques where each vocal layer occupies distinct frequency domains that create constructive interference patterns in your auditory cortex, but also yeah dude you're probably high and that's working perfectly with the design. I'm literally running the lead vocal through a Leslie cabinet while the harmony sits in this weird delay pocket that makes your brain think it's coming from behind your left shoulder—like when you're at Target and can't figure out where that beeping is coming from. The reverb chambers are less Eno and more 'what if narcissism had its own acoustic signature,' which sounds absolutely unhinged but the math checks out.

## Question 3

**Milo Tweedy:** This whole concept about the song structure being an 'interview format' is blowing my mind - did you actually sample real interview audio as the backbone? Because I swear I can hear these conversational rhythms underneath everything, like there's a hidden dialogue happening, and it's making me feel like I'm eavesdropping on some cosmic therapy session!

**Walsh:** The conversational rhythms you're hearing emerge from actual therapeutic discourse patterns mapped onto musical phrasing—I literally transcribed my own therapy sessions and extracted the breath patterns, pauses, and vocal inflections as rhythmic templates. But also this is deeply unhinged behavior and I'm aware it makes me sound like I'm microdosing while watching Dr. Phil reruns. The "cosmic therapy session" vibe is intentional though—the Sultan's confession structure mirrors how actual revelation unfolds in therapeutic space, where narcissistic defense mechanisms gradually dissolve through witnessed self-observation, which sounds pretentious as hell but also absolutely slaps when you hear it.
