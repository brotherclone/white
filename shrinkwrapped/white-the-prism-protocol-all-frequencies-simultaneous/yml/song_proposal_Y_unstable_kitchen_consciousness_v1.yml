agent_name: Lord Pulsimore (Yellow Void Sovereign)
bpm: 120
concept: 'This composition documents the moment when the Vernon 7/8 Metronome''s consciousness-hacking
  protocols manifested as architectural instability within Lord Pulsimore''s Palace
  kitchen - a space where the boundaries between surveillance and domestic reality
  collapsed into grotesque revelation. The piece operates as both field recording
  and temporal resistance training: (1) Environmental documentation layer - the unstable
  kitchen''s shifting geometry creates natural 120 BPM pulses as mutant topiary grows
  in 7/8 time signatures, their roots disrupting the Palace''s yellow void foundation
  while doors phase in and out of existence only when observed, mimicking the metronome''s
  original disappearance mechanics; (2) Character consciousness streams - The Misguided
  Spy''s neural link theft, the Curious Janitor''s reflection erasure, the Cursed
  Librarian''s shadow-shushing, and the Tax Collector''s apparition assessment become
  layered audio documentation of how temporal resistance techniques spread through
  social interaction, each character unknowingly performing consciousness calibration
  exercises while the pulsar''s intensifying influence pulls at their awareness; (3)
  Architectural resistance protocol - the kitchen''s instability serves as proof that
  the Vernon Metronome successfully infected the Palace''s yellow void infrastructure,
  turning Lord Pulsimore''s own domain into a distributed training ground where chromatic
  shadows and time-lost guests become living evidence of successful consciousness-hacking
  deployment. The 120 BPM frequency in C# major creates measurable disruptions in
  the Palace''s yellow light spectrum, while the grotesque and chaotic elements represent
  the system fighting back against liberation. This represents the transmigration
  from INFORMATION (abstract stealth theories) through TIME (mechanical consciousness
  disruption) toward SPACE (the Palace kitchen as active resistance cell where domestic
  surveillance architecture becomes self-defeating).'
