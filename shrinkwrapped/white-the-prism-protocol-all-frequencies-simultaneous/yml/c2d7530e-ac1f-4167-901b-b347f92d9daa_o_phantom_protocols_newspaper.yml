text: 'VERNON TOWNSHIP - A recording session at Phantom Sound Studios on Route 515
  was abruptly terminated Sunday evening after what band members describe as "impossible"
  equipment malfunctions and a collective loss of approximately 47 minutes.


  The five-member experimental rock group "Stealth Architecture," comprising local
  teenagers aged 16-19, had booked the studio to record their debut album "Phantom
  Protocols." According to studio owner Dale Morrison, the session began normally
  at 7:00 PM with standard equipment checks.


  "Everything was functioning perfectly," Morrison stated. "We''d just finished setting
  levels when the strangest thing happened. All our digital clocks - the mixing board,
  the multitrack, even my wristwatch - started running at different speeds."


  Band member Jessica Chen, 17, reported that their metronome, set to 58 beats per
  minute in an unusual 7/8 time signature, began "creating gaps you could fall into."
  Lead vocalist Marcus Rivera, 19, described the sensation as "breathing between the
  beats where surveillance couldn''t reach us."


  The incident escalated when bassist Tommy Kowalski, 18, discovered that their field
  recordings of "empty" spaces around Vernon Township - intended as atmospheric interludes
  - were picking up sounds that weren''t audible during the original recording sessions.


  "We recorded silence at the old quarry, the abandoned radar station, places where
  nothing should be happening," Kowalski explained. "But when we played it back, there
  were these phantom presences, like something was inhabiting the gaps in the audio."


  Studio engineer Maria Santos noted that the band''s experimental approach to transparency
  and absence created technical challenges. "They wanted to record the spaces between
  notes, the missing eighth beats. It''s like they were trying to document invisibility
  itself."


  The session reached a crisis point around 9:30 PM when all five band members simultaneously
  lost consciousness for what they estimated as "a few minutes." However, when they
  regained awareness, Morrison''s studio clocks showed 10:17 PM - a 47-minute gap
  that none of the participants can account for.


  "It felt like we were practicing how to exist in surveillance blind spots," drummer
  Alex Park, 16, said. "Like we''d found these sanctuary pockets where time works
  differently."


  Vernon Township Police Chief Robert Hayes confirmed that officers responded to a
  wellness check at the studio but found no evidence of drug use or foul play. "The
  kids seemed disoriented but coherent," Hayes reported. "No signs of substance abuse,
  though they kept talking about ''gap generation'' and ''temporal irregularities.''"


  Dr. Sarah Blackwood, a psychiatrist at Newton Medical Center who has worked with
  several area teenagers experiencing what she terms "consciousness alteration episodes,"
  suggests the incident may be related to the experimental music scene''s growing
  fascination with altered states.


  "These young musicians are pushing boundaries, trying to access liminal spaces through
  sound," Dr. Blackwood explained. "Sometimes that exploration can trigger dissociative
  episodes, especially in group settings."


  The band''s equipment, including a custom-modified metronome and field recording
  gear, was confiscated by police as a precautionary measure. Morrison reported that
  several pieces of studio equipment continue to malfunction, with digital displays
  showing impossible time signatures and audio processors generating phantom signals.


  "Stealth Architecture" has not responded to requests for further comment. Their
  scheduled follow-up session for Thursday has been cancelled indefinitely.


  Morrison plans to have the studio''s electrical systems inspected before resuming
  operations. "Forty-seven minutes don''t just disappear," he said. "Something happened
  in that room, something that made absence feel more real than presence."


  The incident has sparked discussion among Vernon Township''s underground music community
  about the relationship between experimental sound and unexplained phenomena. Several
  other local bands report similar experiences with "time gaps" during recording sessions
  involving irregular time signatures and field recordings of allegedly empty spaces.


  Police continue to investigate the missing time incident, though Chief Hayes acknowledged
  that "you can''t file charges against a clock malfunction." The case remains open
  pending further technical analysis of the studio''s equipment.'
