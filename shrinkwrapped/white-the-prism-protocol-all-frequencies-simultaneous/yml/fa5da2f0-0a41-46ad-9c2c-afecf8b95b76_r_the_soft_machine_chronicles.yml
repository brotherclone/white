excerpts:
- 'The word is flesh and the flesh is word. Cut-up reality bleeding through the typewriter
  keys like junk through a needle. Hassan''s boys run wild through the Control Machine,
  their bodies folding and unfolding in geometric impossibilities. The Soft Machine
  churns out another reality sandwich, extra mayo hold the linear time.


  Bradley the Buyer moves through Interzone like smoke through a ventilator shaft.
  His briefcase contains the blueprints for tomorrow''s addiction - not junk, not
  sex, not power - but the sweet narcotic of continuous present. The Nova Police are
  closing in but they''re always three moves behind the cut-up.


  "Time to scramble the frequencies," Bradley mutters, his voice cutting through dimensions
  like a hot knife through celluloid. The Soft Machine responds with mechanical orgasm,
  gears grinding out new configurations of flesh and chrome.


  In the distance, the Algebra of Need calculates its next victim.'
- 'Control addicts sweat it out in the Reality Studio, their withdrawal symptoms manifesting
  as temporal displacement and cellular rearrangement. Dr. Benway observes from behind
  his clipboard, making notes in a language that hasn''t been invented yet.


  "The human nervous system," he explains to his assistant (a gray junk ghost with
  calculator eyes), "is nothing more than a biological tape recorder playing back
  the same program over and over. But what happens when we cut the tape? Splice it?
  Run it backwards?"


  The assistant''s face flickers between male and female, young and old, human and
  machine. "The subjects report experiencing all possibilities simultaneously, Doctor."


  "Excellent. Prepare the next batch for processing. The Soft Machine is hungry."


  Outside the laboratory windows, the city writhes in cut-up fragments - neon signs
  spelling backwards messages, pedestrians walking through walls, time folding in
  on itself like origami made of meat.'
