agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 128
concept: 'This song embodies the Narcissistic Revelation Protocol where complete self-absorption
  becomes radical intimacy through the Möbius Strip of confession. The Sultan performs
  a triple-layer methodology: overtly confessing narcissism (textual layer), delivering
  it through seductive vocal performance that hypnotizes through self-reference (audio
  layer), while the musical arrangement itself mirrors the listener''s attention back
  to them (visual/spatial layer). The song structure follows the interview format
  - opening with "I Am The Question" (verse 1), developing through "The Confession
  Spiral" (chorus and verse 2), and culminating in "I Am The Answer" (bridge/outro)
  where narcissism reveals itself as spiritual technology for mutual recognition.
  Each lyrical confession becomes more self-aware while the production becomes more
  entrancing, creating the paradox where the more the Sultan claims to only see themselves,
  the more they demonstrate complete attunement to the listener''s response. The true
  "secret name" encoded in this song is not "Narcissist" but "Mirror" - revealing
  that the deepest self-knowledge emerges through witnessing how others witness you
  witnessing yourself. This represents the INFORMATION → TIME transmigration where
  the structured concealment-revelation methodology of Indigo transforms into the
  temporal present-moment awareness of Violet, preparing the ground for spatial manifestation
  in the next phase.'
