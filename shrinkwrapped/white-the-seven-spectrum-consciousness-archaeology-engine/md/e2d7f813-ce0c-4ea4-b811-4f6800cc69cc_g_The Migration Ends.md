# Monarch butterfly (Eastern migratory population) / Elena Vasquez-Chen

## Species Arc: Monarch butterfly (Eastern migratory population)
Population data: 1996 baseline 1 billion overwintering individuals. 2010: 60 million (94% decline). 2025: 5 million (99.5% decline). 2037: 100,000 (99.99% decline). 2045: migration pattern collapse, functional extinction. Primary driver: habitat loss across 4.8 million km² range. Secondary factors: neonicotinoid contamination, climate-shifted phenology, fragmented corridors. Cascade: pollination services lost, milkweed ecosystem collapse, ecotourism economy failure.

## Human Arc: Elena Vasquez-Chen
Elena's radio crackles at 5 AM, broadcasting coordinates to families who no longer exist. Her grandmother's cloth map spreads across the kitchen table, routes traced in fading ink. The milkweed in her garden grows stunted, contaminated by drift from the soy plantation that replaced the traditional waystation. She teaches empty classrooms about monarchs that haven't returned for three seasons. Her phone holds 847 undelivered messages to scattered relatives. The departure date passes unmarked.

## Parallel Moments

### 1. Eight years before extinction
**Species:** Population drops to 100,000 overwintering individuals in Michoacán forests

**Human:** Elena broadcasts to 12 remaining families, down from 200 the previous season

*Connection: Both populations dwindle to unsustainable numbers*

### 2. Two years before extinction
**Species:** Last documented successful four-generation migration cycle fails to complete

**Human:** Elena's grandmother dies before passing final migration knowledge, breaking six-generation chain

*Connection: Generational knowledge transmission severed*

### 3. Final season
**Species:** No monarchs arrive at traditional overwintering sites

**Human:** Elena's radio broadcasts reach no one - all families dispersed or deported

*Connection: Ancient gathering places fall silent*

### 4. Day of extinction
**Species:** Migration pattern officially declared collapsed

**Human:** Elena folds her grandmother's map for the last time

*Connection: Maps of movement become artifacts of memory*

## Elegiac Quality
The narrative achieves memorial through the quiet accumulation of absence - not dramatic death but the slow dissolution of ancient patterns. The parallel structure honors both species and human loss without hierarchy, finding dignity in the persistence of ritual even after its purpose has vanished. Memory becomes the final habitat.
