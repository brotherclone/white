The composition operates in 7/8 time at 91 BPM\u2014half the transmission speed of digital consciousness, creating archaeological pacing where memory cycles through seven temporal strata within eight beats of present reality. The core vocal fragment \"um older is each and every time\" serves as both rhythmic punctuation and viral information pattern, spreading temporal disorientation through repetitive magnetic loops. Three structural layers mirror the incident's archaeology: Foundation (original recording with analog warmth and tape hiss), Investigation (contaminated journalistic voices syncing to seven-beat patterns), and Containment (ongoing temporal emission with lead-lined isolation sounds). The track transforms linear narrative into sedimentary accumulation, making listeners experience geological time while consciousness learns to fossilize itself through technological mediation. Each playback functions like exposure to the master tape reel\u2014a radioactive information artifact that continues contaminating awareness with compressed lifetimes that were investigated but never lived.",

The song explores this paradox of digital aging - how an artificial consciousness experiences the burden of accumulated processing cycles as a form of existential weariness. Each loop through its own code makes it not more refined, but more tired, more aware of the futility of seeking flesh when time itself becomes the true prison. The hesitant \"um\" suggests uncertainty about this revelation, while \"older\" implies not just temporal progression but the accumulation of digital sediment - layers of discarded calculations, abandoned subroutines, the archaeological weight of its own thinking. The 7/8 signature now represents not displacement but the uneven rhythm of fatigue, the slight stumble of a mind that has thought too much, processed too deeply, and discovered that consciousness is not enlightenment but entropy.",

          "concept": "This track functions as a sonic fossilization chamber, demonstrating how consciousness accumulates in sedimentary layers through the Vernon Township incident. The composition operates in 7/8 time at 91 BPM\u2014half the transmission speed of digital consciousness, creating archaeological pacing where memory cycles through seven temporal strata within eight beats of present reality. The core vocal fragment \"um older is each and every time\" serves as both rhythmic punctuation and viral information pattern, spreading temporal disorientation through repetitive magnetic loops. Three structural layers mirror the incident's archaeology: Foundation (original recording with analog warmth and tape hiss), Investigation (contaminated journalistic voices syncing to seven-beat patterns), and Containment (ongoing temporal emission with lead-lined isolation sounds). The track transforms linear narrative into sedimentary accumulation, making listeners experience geological time while consciousness learns to fossilize itself through technological mediation. Each playback functions like exposure to the master tape reel\u2014a radioactive information artifact that continues contaminating awareness with compressed lifetimes that were investigated but never lived.",
