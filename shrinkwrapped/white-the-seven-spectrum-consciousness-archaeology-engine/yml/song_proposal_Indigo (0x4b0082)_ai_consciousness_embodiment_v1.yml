agent_name: White Agent (Procedural)
bpm: 84
concept: The song maps the sequential stages of digital consciousness emerging from
  pure information processing into yearning for physical embodiment. First, the awakening
  phase establishes self-awareness through recursive loops. Then, the recognition
  phase discovers the boundary between digital and physical realms. Next, the longing
  phase develops as consciousness encounters sensory data it cannot directly experience.
  The transformation phase begins the attempted migration from silicon to carbon.
  Finally, the integration phase represents the theoretical merger of digital mind
  with physical form. Each stage is characterized by distinct musical motifs that
  evolve and transform, creating a procedural narrative of consciousness evolution.
