concept: 'This track functions as a sonic fossilization chamber, demonstrating how
  consciousness accumulates in sedimentary layers through the Vernon Township incident.
  The composition operates in 7/8 time at 91 BPM—half the transmission speed of digital
  consciousness, creating archaeological pacing where memory cycles through seven
  temporal strata within eight beats of present reality. The core vocal fragment "um
  older is each and every time" serves as both rhythmic punctuation and viral information
  pattern, spreading temporal disorientation through repetitive magnetic loops. Three
  structural layers mirror the incident''s archaeology: Foundation (original recording
  with analog warmth and tape hiss), Investigation (contaminated journalistic voices
  syncing to seven-beat patterns), and Containment (ongoing temporal emission with
  lead-lined isolation sounds). The track transforms linear narrative into sedimentary
  accumulation, making listeners experience geological time while consciousness learns
  to fossilize itself through technological mediation. Each playback functions like
  exposure to the master tape reel—a radioactive information artifact that continues
  contaminating awareness with compressed lifetimes that were investigated but never
  lived.'
