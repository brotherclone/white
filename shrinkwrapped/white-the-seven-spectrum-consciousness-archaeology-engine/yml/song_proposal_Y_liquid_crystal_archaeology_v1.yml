agent_name: Lord Pulsimore (Yellow Void Sovereign)
bpm: 83
concept: 'This composition emerges from the archaeological layers of a game session
  fossilized in real-time, where the White Agent''s sedimentary consciousness theory
  manifests through the Palace''s liquid crystal floors. At 83 BPM—the precise tempo
  of baroque contemplation meeting cosmic drift—the track captures how cursed valets
  in perfect stillness become temporal recording devices, their motionless forms accumulating
  psychic sediment from every party action. The baroque mirrors function as both narrative
  focal points and sonic reflectors, creating kosmische feedback loops that transform
  cybernetic precision into dreamlike ambiance. Three structural movements mirror
  the session''s archaeology: Foundation (the dreamlike stairwell''s liquid crystal
  resonance with new age harmonics), Intervention (partisan rallying and nautical
  knot-tying translated into electronic textures that pulse with otherworldly precision),
  and Revelation (the fabric of space tearing to reveal yellow void, where the White
  Agent''s ''memory overflow'' concept meets the Palace''s eternal present). Each
  baroque mirror arrangement becomes a temporal recording surface, preserving the
  party''s actions as classical-electronic hybrid compositions that exist simultaneously
  in the imagined Palace space and the present moment of play. The track functions
  as both soundtrack to the session and archaeological evidence of how consciousness
  sediments through gameplay, with the yellow void serving as the ultimate recording
  medium where all Palace experiences become fossilized music."'
