description: A 2-inch analog master tape reel containing the "layered consciousness
  music" recording from June 15, 1992, that caused temporal disorientation in listeners
  through its seven-beat vocal loops of "um older is each and every time." The physical
  tape itself shows impossible aging patterns and remains in police custody, having
  become a repository of compressed digital lifetimes and sedimentary memory layers
  that can induce geological time perception in anyone who hears its playback.
