excerpts:
- 'The Olympia Press edition bears the unmistakable marks of its underground origins
  - that peculiar mixture of technological prophecy and libertine excess that characterized
  the final years of the millennium. Cooper''s narrative unfolds across three distinct
  movements: "The Acceleration" (pages 1-280), chronicling the early days when code
  was still poetry and venture capital flowed like wine at Dionysian festivals; "The
  Burn Rate" (pages 281-620), where the author''s lens turns clinical, dissecting
  the transformation of dreamers into predators; and finally "The Crash" (pages 621-845),
  a hallucinogenic descent into the post-bubble wasteland where former boy-kings wander
  the Peninsula like digital nomads searching for their next fix.


  The book''s structure mirrors the very chaos it describes - chapters fragment and
  multiply like viral code, timelines collapse into recursive loops, and characters
  merge and split with the fluid logic of venture-backed startups. Cooper employs
  what he calls "network narrative," where each section can be read independently
  yet gains meaning only through its connections to the whole. It is, as one underground
  critic noted, "Burroughs meets Wired Magazine in a back-alley server farm."'
- 'From "The Acceleration" - Chapter 3: "Holy Algorithms"


  The garage in Palo Alto hummed with the frequency of pure ambition. Danny Morse,
  nineteen and already burned out on Stanford''s computer science program, had discovered
  something more intoxicating than any drug the Haight had ever offered: the rush
  of watching venture capitalists bid against each other for a piece of his soul.


  "They don''t understand," he whispered to Sarah Chen as she traced lines of code
  across his naked back with her fingertip. "They think we''re selling software. We''re
  selling transcendence."


  The Sequoia partner had offered twelve million for thirty percent. The Kleiner Perkins
  team wanted to throw in mentorship and board seats. But Danny was holding out for
  something else - that moment when the old world would crack open like an egg and
  spill its golden contents across the Valley floor.


  Outside, the fog rolled in from the Bay, carrying with it the salt smell of money
  and the electric ozone of futures being born. Sarah''s laptop screen cast blue shadows
  across their intertwined bodies as the algorithm they''d written together learned
  to dream.'
