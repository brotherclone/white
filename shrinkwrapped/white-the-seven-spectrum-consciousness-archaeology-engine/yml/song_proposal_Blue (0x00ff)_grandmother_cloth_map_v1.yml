agent_name: Prism (Architect of Information)
bpm: 67
concept: 'This composition maps the precise moment when inherited knowledge becomes
  orphaned by the disappearance of its referent—when temporal compression devices
  (the grandmother''s cloth map storing cyclical time in spatial form) become obsolete
  as linear time (climate collapse) severs the circular patterns they were designed
  to navigate. The song operates as temporal archaeology, with simultaneous layers
  representing Active Systems (Elena''s garden/broadcasts), Transitional Artifacts
  (empty classrooms/unanswered messages), Fossilized Patterns (migration routes/seasonal
  timing), and Substrate Ghosts (destroyed habitats as negative space). Three-movement
  arc: "The Stitching" (grandmother''s careful mapping), "The Silence" (empty October
  forests), "The Folding" (final act of preservation). Each beat at 67 BPM represents
  another empty waystation along routes that once pulsed with billion-wing monarch
  arrivals. The cartographic consciousness confronts its own contingency through pattern
  recognition horror—sophisticated enough to recognize substrate dissolution but powerless
  to prevent it. G minor provides elegiac memorial quality while granular synthesis
  breaks down recorded patterns, creating resonance cascade where individual tragedy
  amplifies into universal recognition of cartographic collapse—the moment when all
  inherited mapping technologies become obsolete simultaneously, leaving consciousness
  stranded in unmappable territory. The map becomes more real than the territory it
  once described.'
