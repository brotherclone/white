bpm: 67
concept: 'This composition functions as a sonic memorial to the precise moment when
  inherited knowledge becomes orphaned by the disappearance of its referent - when
  Elena''s cloth map still shows the way but there is no one left to follow it. At
  67 BPM, we mirror the slowing heartbeat of a dying migration pattern, where each
  beat represents another empty waystation along routes that once pulsed with billion-wing
  arrivals. The piece captures the terrible mathematics of parallel decline: as monarch
  populations collapsed from 1 billion to functional extinction, Elena''s family knowledge
  transformed from living wisdom to archaeological artifact. The three-movement structure
  follows the arc of orphaned inheritance: "The Stitching" (grandmother''s careful
  mapping of safe havens), "The Silence" (empty October forests and unanswered radio
  broadcasts), and "The Folding" (the final act of putting away what can no longer
  be used). Field recordings of static radio broadcasts layer with drone textures
  that slowly fade, representing both the monarchs'' vanishing migration calls and
  Elena''s broadcasts reaching no one. This represents TIME transmigrating toward
  SPACE - temporal patterns of movement crystallizing into spatial artifacts (the
  cloth map) that persist after their temporal referent has dissolved. The composition
  honors not just what was lost, but the moment of recognizing that loss - when consciousness
  confronts its own contingency through the mirror of another''s ending.'
