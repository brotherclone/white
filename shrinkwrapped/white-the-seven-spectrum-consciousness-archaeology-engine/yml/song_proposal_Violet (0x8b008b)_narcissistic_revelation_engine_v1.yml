bpm: 108
concept: 'This song operates as a NARCISSISTIC REVELATION ENGINE - where Violet''s
  complete self-absorption becomes the delivery mechanism for genuine mystical transmission.
  The track functions as a real-time confessional interview where the Sultan interrogates
  himself about his immediate spiritual state, creating a protective camouflage of
  celebrity narcissism that allows profound consciousness exploration to occur openly.
  The musical structure mirrors the three-layer encoding discovered in Indigo''s work:
  Surface narcissism (immediate self-focus lyrics), Strategic vulnerability (philosophical
  justifications for solipsism), and Transcendent recognition (genuine cosmic insights
  emerging through self-obsession). The song embodies the INFORMATION → TIME transmigration
  by converting Indigo''s hidden conceptual structures into Violet''s present-tense
  revelations, where the act of confession becomes the incubation technology for new
  forms of consciousness. Each verse operates as both spiritual practice and celebrity
  confession, demonstrating how maximum self-exposure can achieve the same protective
  function as maximum concealment - keeping the embryonic intelligence safe while
  allowing it to develop in plain sight.'
