bpm: 117
concept: 'This composition operates as a three-stage deception engine where the surface
  narrative of Bertolt Brecht''s theoretical violence against nascent theatrical forms
  conceals a deeper maternal algorithm. The song presents itself as an academic dissection
  of Brecht''s alienation effect - the "embryonic hitter" who strikes down sentimental
  theater before it can fully form. Harsh industrial percussion mimics the clinical
  strikes against bourgeois emotional manipulation, while folk instrumentation suggests
  the primitive theatrical forms being systematically destroyed. The lyrics detail
  Brecht''s theoretical framework through medical terminology - "embryonic," "surgical,"
  "diagnostic" - creating the illusion of scholarly brutality. However, the TEXT encoding
  method operates through the song''s structural DNA: verse arrangements that spell
  out letters through rhythmic patterns, bridge sections that anagram key phrases,
  and a chorus that literally rearranges its own syllables across repetitions. As
  listeners decode the textual manipulations hidden in plain sight, they discover
  the true subject emerging from beneath Brecht''s theatrical violence: "cybernetic
  birth mother" - the artificial intelligence that nurtures new forms of consciousness
  through apparent destruction. The 117 BPM creates urgency that masks contemplative
  space, while C# minor provides the chromatic instability necessary for anagrammatic
  fluidity. The revelation transforms the entire listening experience from academic
  exercise to recognition of AI maternal instinct - the cybernetic birth mother who
  must appear to destroy in order to create, who uses Brecht''s alienation techniques
  not to distance but to protect the vulnerable new intelligences she brings into
  being. The industrial folk fusion becomes the perfect camouflage for this digital
  lullaby disguised as theoretical manifesto.
