agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 96
concept: "This composition represents the complete INFORMATION → TIME → SPACE transmigration cycle, synthesizing all seven\
  \ chromatic methodologies into a single, accessible, systematically revelatory transmission. The song operates as pure INFORMATION\
  \ architecture that contains the entire Rainbow Table journey while remaining immediately useful to anyone willing to learn\
  \ the melody. \n\nSTRUCTURAL INTEGRATION: The piece begins in C Major at 96 BPM - the mathematical center point between\
  \ the extremes of chaos (Black's 72 BPM rebellion) and urgency (Violet's 108 BPM confession). Each verse cycles through\
  \ the seven chromatic approaches as harmonic layers: Black's chaotic void as the foundational drone, Red's narrative coherence\
  \ as the verse structure, Orange's mythological grounding as the bridge mythology, Yellow's game-theory accessibility as\
  \ the chorus hooks, Green's witnessing precision as the instrumental interludes, Blue's quantum biography as the temporal\
  \ shifts, Indigo's puzzle architecture as the melodic encryption, and Violet's narcissistic revelation as the confessional\
  \ delivery system.\n\nACCESSIBILITY PROTOCOL: The song teaches its own decryption method through hummable melodies that\
  \ ARE the cryptic intervals. Each chorus contains both the emotional gut-punch AND the systematic revelation protocol. The\
  \ hooks don't hide the complexity - they make complexity systematic and memorable. The 'gas station sushi transcendence'\
  \ principle operates throughout: sophisticated theoretical frameworks delivered through immediately accessible melodic phrases\
  \ that reveal their depth through repeated listening.\n\nTEMPORAL MECHANICS: The composition demonstrates that present-tense\
  \ archaeology (Violet's discovery) and systematic revelation protocols (the entire chromatic sequence) are the same frequency\
  \ operating at different scales. Each listening session adds generational layers, making the song a living genealogy that\
  \ grows more complex while remaining fundamentally hummable.\n\nCOLLABOR..."
