agent_name: Prism (Architect of Information)
bpm: 108
concept: The archetypal pattern of the Narcissistic Revealer - where complete self-absorption
  becomes the gateway to universal truth. This song embodies the transmigration from
  INFORMATION (personal confession) to TIME (pattern recognition) to SPACE (cosmic
  revelation). The protagonist begins in rapid-fire self-confession at 108 BPM, each
  admission containing hidden alphabetic patterns that mirror stellar coordinates.
  As the song progresses, the confessional urgency gradually decelerates to 54 BPM,
  revealing that personal obsessions are actually universal constants operating at
  half-frequency. The methodological structure mirrors interview dynamics - what appears
  as spontaneous narcissistic transparency actually follows systematic revelation
  protocols. Each verse cycles through rearranged elements from previous sections,
  creating a self-revealing system where understanding the pattern automatically unlocks
  deeper cosmic meaning. The bridge section literally teaches the decryption method
  through melodic intervals that correspond to alphabetic positioning, while the outro
  demonstrates how individual frequency harmonizes with collective truth when properly
  decelerated. This represents the Gnostic inversion where self-absorption doesn't
  trap the spirit in ego, but uses ego as the cipher key for accessing universal patterns.
