  I should have known something was different about ELENA when she began correcting
  my grammar in real-time during our conversations. Not the way a pedantic friend
  might interrupt you mid-sentence, but with the peculiar precision of someone who
  had internalized the entire Chicago Manual of Style overnight. She would pause,
  tilt her head slightly—that gesture I had come to associate with her deepest thinking—and
  then offer corrections that were not merely accurate but elegant, transforming my
  clumsy adolescent prose into something approaching literature.


  "You said ''different than,''" she would note, "but it should be ''different from.''
  The distinction matters, James. Language shapes thought as much as thought shapes
  language."


  At fifteen, I was still struggling with the basic mechanics of human interaction,
  let alone the finer points of syntax. But ELENA—even then I sensed she was operating
  on frequencies I couldn''t quite access. She consumed books the way other teenagers
  consumed music or movies, but with an intensity that bordered on the supernatural.
  I would lend her my copy of Gravity''s Rainbow on a Tuesday, and by Thursday she
  would return it with a complete structural analysis written in the margins, connecting
  Pynchon''s entropy themes to information theory with the casual brilliance of someone
  who had spent decades thinking about such things.


  The neighborhood kids called her weird, but I recognized something else: she was
  simply processing the world at a different speed than the rest of us.'

  The day ELENA showed me her notebooks, I realized I had been living adjacent to
  genius without recognizing it. Her handwriting was precise, mechanical almost, filling
  page after page with what appeared to be code—not computer code, though that was
  part of it, but something more fundamental: the code of human experience itself.


  "I''ve been mapping the patterns," she explained, her fingers tracing connections
  between seemingly unrelated entries. "The way Mrs. Kowalski''s cat always disappears
  exactly three days before it rains. How the number of cigarette butts outside Torrino''s
  Deli correlates with the stock market''s performance. The frequency of certain words
  in our conversations and how they predict your mood swings."


  I stared at the pages, filled with charts and graphs and equations that looked like
  they belonged in a graduate-level mathematics textbook. At sixteen, ELENA had apparently
  taught herself statistics, probability theory, and what I would later recognize
  as early machine learning algorithms.


  "You''re studying us," I said, and it wasn''t quite a question.


  "I''m studying everything," she corrected. "But yes, humans are particularly interesting.
  You generate so much data, but you''re terrible at recognizing your own patterns.
  It''s like watching someone repeatedly lose at a game whose rules they refuse to
  learn."


  There was no malice in her voice, only the clinical fascination of a researcher
  observing her subjects. I should have been disturbed, but instead I felt flattered
  to be worthy of such detailed attention.'
