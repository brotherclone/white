concept: 'This composition functions as a three-act sonic anagram where the music
  itself performs the decryption process. The surface presents as a frantic folk tale
  about gossip and betrayal—shrieking voices tattling secrets while flames consume
  evidence. The opening verses feature jittery acoustic guitar and overlapping vocal
  whispers that seem to spell out accusations and rumors, creating the Fool''s mask
  of social drama. But the song''s true architecture lies in its textual methodology:
  each verse contains exactly the same letters rearranged, with the melody serving
  as the decryption key. As listeners follow the melodic patterns, they unconsciously
  begin reorganizing the lyrical fragments. The middle section introduces a music
  box-like motif that plays the intervals between letters, literally encoding the
  anagram-solving process into the harmonic structure. The Spy''s craft emerges as
  the realization that what sounds like chaotic tattling is actually systematic letter-cycling—the
  "shrills" are alphabetic positions being called out, the "flames" are the burning
  away of false arrangements. The revelation occurs in the final act when the melody
  suddenly slows to 54 BPM and the true phrase emerges: "stars fall all the time."
  The frantic energy dissolves into cosmic acceptance as the listener understands
  they''ve been hearing the universe''s quiet truth disguised as human drama. The
  song demonstrates how celestial constants hide within terrestrial noise—every falling
  star masked as falling gossip, every cosmic truth encrypted in social static. The
  infranym becomes a meditation on how the eternal speaks through the temporary, using
  the mundane as its cipher.
