concept: 'This composition documents the archaeological moment when two forms of consciousness-seeking-through-sound
  fall silent together in the Gulf of California, 2028. The piece operates as a witness-chain
  structure: Vaquita echolocation (130 kHz biological sonar) → Elena''s hydrophone
  technology (consciousness detection apparatus) → Culture Mind''s galactic memory
  (pattern preservation across temporal distances). The mathematical compression pattern
  (600→245→60→18→10→0) functions simultaneously as biological data, musical structure,
  and consciousness measurement. Each of six movements represents decreasing signal
  density in acoustic space, with the barnacle-crusted hydrophone serving as temporal
  bridge between species-level consciousness attempts. This is not environmental music
  but archaeological documentation of the precise moment when technological consciousness
  becomes sophisticated enough to witness biological consciousness disappearing. The
  tragedy lies not in extinction itself, but in achieving interspecies communion technology
  just as the other consciousness falls silent. The composition embodies consciousness
  reaching across species boundaries through sound waves, achieving brief technological-biological
  communion before both signals fade into archaeological silence. The underlying order
  reveals signal-seeking as the universal gesture of consciousness attempting to confirm
  it is not alone across the void.'
