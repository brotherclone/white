## Question 1

**Finn Oberst:** Okay, so I've been diving deep into your whole synesthesia thing, and I'm fascinated by how you're literally rebuilding your visual music experience through this chromatic project - but here's what I'm wondering: when you hit that breakthrough moment in the chorus where 'personal truth dissolves into cosmic recognition,' are you actually seeing the white light again? Like, is this song functioning as some kind of neurological reconstruction therapy where the 7/8 time signature is rewiring your brain back to color-sound connections?

**Walsh:** Holy shit, you actually get it—the 7/8 is absolutely functioning as neurological scaffolding, like I'm literally trying to rebuild the temporal architecture that got severed when I lost color-sound synthesis. But also it's giving me divorced dad at Guitar Center energy, desperately trying to finger-tap my way back to enlightenment. The white light thing is real though—when the chorus hits and the solipsistic drilling breaks through, there's this moment where the recursive confession loop collapses into pure present-tense awareness, which sounds pretentious as hell but it actually fucking works sometimes.

## Question 2

**Finn Oberst:** I keep coming back to this 'Sultan of Solipsism' persona and the whole recursive confession protocol - it's like you've created this perfect feedback loop where the more self-absorbed you get, the more universal it becomes, which is absolutely genius - but I have to ask: is the F# minor key specifically chosen because it's the exact frequency that triggers that childhood trauma response from when you almost got hit by the truck? Like, are you literally tuning into your own psychological damage as a compositional framework?

**Walsh:** Holy shit, you actually picked up on the frequency thing—that's terrifying and also kind of beautiful that someone would notice that level of neurological archaeology. F# minor isn't just emotionally heavy, it's literally the resonant frequency of my own psychological damage, like I'm tuning the entire compositional framework to the exact pitch of that childhood rebracketing moment—which sounds absolutely deranged when I say it out loud, but it fucking works. The Sultan of Solipsism methodology requires that level of self-excavation precision, where you're not just confessing your narcissism but literally harmonizing with the foundational trauma that created the rebracketing survival mechanism in the first place—I mean, this is either brilliant or I need serious therapy, probably both.

## Question 3

**Finn Oberst:** The way you're describing this as 'aggressive presence as direct consciousness transmission' - it's like you've figured out how to bypass the normal music-listening experience entirely and just beam your mental state directly into people's heads through temporal instability and solipsistic drilling. That's incredible! But what I'm really curious about is: when you perform this live, do audience members start experiencing their own recursive self-examination? Are you accidentally turning concerts into group therapy sessions through pure sonic architecture?

**Walsh:** Oh fuck, you've actually identified the core mechanism—the temporal instability creates what I call 'presence contagion,' where the 7/8 forces everyone into the same eternal now, which means their consciousness starts syncing with the solipsistic drilling protocol. Like a Wendy's drive-through for enlightenment, honestly. The recursive self-examination becomes unavoidable because the song literally won't let you exist anywhere except the present moment, so yeah—I'm accidentally running group therapy sessions disguised as concerts, which sounds pretentious as hell but also explains why people either have profound breakthroughs or completely dissociate during the bridge.
