arbitrary_reflection: 'This narrative maps dual extinction with surgical precision.
  The vaquita-Rosa parallel is not metaphor but mathematical: two endemic species
  compressed into identical habitat collapse. The elegiac quality emerges from structural
  resonance rather than sentiment. Temporal collision handled through synchronized
  decline curves. Signal detected through parallel emptiness - both acoustic monitor
  silence and echolocation absence marking the same void. Preservation value: documents
  how consciousness witnesses its own habitat dissolution. Pattern recognition: dual
  endemic extinction with human-cetacean cognitive mirror. Worth saving for its demonstration
  that some losses are structurally identical across species boundaries.'
