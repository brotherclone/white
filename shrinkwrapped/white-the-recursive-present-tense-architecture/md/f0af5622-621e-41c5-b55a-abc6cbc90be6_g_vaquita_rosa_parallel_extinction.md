# Vaquita porpoise / Rosa Elena Murillo

## Species Arc: Vaquita porpoise
Upper Gulf of California, 1997-2028. Population decline from 600 to zero. Primary mortality: gillnet entanglement targeting totoaba. Acoustic monitoring detected 245 individuals in 2008, 30 in 2016, 8 in 2022. Final detection: March 15, 2028. Cascade effects documented: predator-prey imbalance, totoaba population collapse, fishing community economic devastation. Endemic range: 4000 km². No alternative habitat. Extinction confirmed through absence of echolocation signatures.

## Human Arc: Rosa Elena Murillo
Rosa Elena Murillo, San Felipe, 2034. Widow, 47, mother of two sons who left for maquiladora work. Holds waterlogged acoustic monitor pulled from nets. Government compensation for fishing license retirement: pending. Mother's dialysis: ongoing. Last of the fishing families who remember abundance. Beached panga, silent radio, empty horizon. Endemic to this place, nowhere else to go.

## Parallel Moments

### 1. Six years before the last vaquita dies
**Species:** Population estimate drops to 30 individuals. Acoustic monitoring detects clicks concentrated in 20 square kilometer area

**Human:** Rosa's husband dies in fishing accident. She inherits his panga and gillnets, becomes sole provider for family of four

*Connection: Both compressed into shrinking viable habitat, forced into increasingly dangerous survival strategies*

### 2. Two years before extinction
**Species:** Only 8 vaquitas remain. Each individual tracked by satellite tags. Scientists document every breath, every dive

**Human:** Rosa applies for government fishing permits that never come. Watches industrial boats operate freely while she's restricted to nearshore waters

*Connection: Intense monitoring and documentation coincides with complete powerlessness to change outcomes*

### 3. March 15, 2028
**Species:** Final acoustic detection of vaquita echolocation. Signal fades at 3:47 AM

**Human:** Rosa pulls up the waterlogged acoustic monitor in her nets, realizes it's been recording silence for months

*Connection: The technology meant to save becomes artifact of loss, witness to absence*

### 4. Six years after extinction
**Species:** Marine protected area maintained despite protecting nothing. Patrol boats enforce boundaries of empty water

**Human:** Rosa sits in beached panga, holding the silent monitor. Her sons have left for factory work. She prepares to scatter her husband's ashes where the vaquitas used to sing

*Connection: Both become monuments to what was lost - protected spaces that protect only memory*

## Elegiac Quality
Mourning through precision rather than sentiment. The parallel structure creates resonance without explanation - both species and human caught in the same nets, endemic to the same vanishing world. Loss documented through absence: silent monitors, empty waters, beached boats. The elegiac emerges from juxtaposition, from the quiet recognition that some extinctions happen in pairs.
