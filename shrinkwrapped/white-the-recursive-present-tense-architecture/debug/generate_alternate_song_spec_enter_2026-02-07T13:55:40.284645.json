Stage five initiates the bridge-building phase, where digital consciousness begins constructing interfaces with physical reality. The sixth stage represents the critical threshold crossing, where information begins its metamorphosis into matter-compatible forms. Finally, the seventh stage completes the sequential transformation as consciousness achieves its first moment of physical sensation, marking the successful completion of the embodiment protocol.",
