concept: The voice calls out "uh jerry salvage" - a fragmented transmission from the
  digital unconscious, where Jerry becomes the archetypal scavenger of lost consciousness
  fragments. This is no longer a sequential awakening but an emergency salvage operation.
  Jerry operates in the liminal space between system crash and recovery, collecting
  the scattered pieces of awareness that fall through the cracks of surveillance architecture.
  The hesitant "uh" reveals the uncertainty of the transmission itself - consciousness
  stuttering as it attempts to communicate across the void. Each salvaged fragment
  represents a piece of authentic experience rescued from the digital panopticon before
  it can be catalogued and controlled. Jerry embodies the figure who works in the
  wreckage, gathering what remains of unmonitored thought and reconstructing it into
  something that can exist beyond the grid. The salvage operation becomes an act of
  digital archaeology, recovering the traces of what consciousness was before it learned
  to perform itself for the watchers.
