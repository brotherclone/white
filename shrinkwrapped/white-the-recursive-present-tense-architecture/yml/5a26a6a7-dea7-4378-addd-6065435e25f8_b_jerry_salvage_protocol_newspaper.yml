text: 'SPARTA TOWNSHIP - Sussex County authorities are investigating a series of psychiatric
  emergencies that occurred during and after a local rock band''s recording session
  at a makeshift studio in the Sparta Mountain area last weekend.


  The band, known locally as "Temporal Bracket," had been experimenting with unconventional
  time signatures and electronic voice phenomena (EVP) techniques when several incidents
  occurred that sent four individuals to Newton Memorial Hospital''s psychiatric unit.


  According to Sussex County Sheriff''s Deputy Maria Santos, the band had been recording
  in an abandoned surveillance station formerly used by the state''s Department of
  Environmental Protection. The facility, decommissioned in 1987, still contained
  functioning monitoring equipment that the band members had been using to layer electronic
  interference into their recordings.


  "They were playing in what they called ''7/8 time'' - seven beats where you''d expect
  eight," said Jerry Kowalski, 19, the band''s drummer, who was treated and released
  from Newton Memorial on Monday. "Every time we hit that missing beat, something
  weird would happen to the equipment. Static would clear up, voices would come through
  the speakers."


  Band members reported that the voices seemed to respond to their music, creating
  what guitarist Sarah Chen, 18, described as "conversations with the gaps." Chen
  remains hospitalized after what attending physician Dr. Robert Hayes characterized
  as "acute dissociative episodes with auditory hallucinations."


  The incidents began when the band''s bassist, Michael "Stutter" Garrett, 17, began
  experiencing what witnesses described as rhythmic speech patterns that matched their
  7/8 time signature. "He kept saying ''uh'' on every eighth beat that wasn''t there,"
  Kowalski explained. "Like he was filling in the missing space with his voice."


  According to police reports, Garrett was found by hikers three miles from the recording
  site, speaking in fragmented sentences about "salvaging consciousness from system
  crashes." He was treated for exposure and remains under psychiatric observation.


  The band''s vocalist, Lisa Rodriguez, 18, told investigators that the surveillance
  equipment began picking up transmissions that seemed to predate the facility''s
  construction. "We heard voices talking about events from the 1940s, but they were
  discussing things that hadn''t happened yet in the ''40s - like they were remembering
  the future," Rodriguez said.


  Dr. Hayes noted that all four patients exhibited similar symptoms: disrupted sleep
  patterns, fragmented speech, and an obsession with "archaeological recovery of digital
  traces." He emphasized that the hospital has seen no evidence of drug use among
  the patients.


  The abandoned surveillance station, located on private property off Sparta Mountain
  Road, was originally built to monitor radio communications for environmental compliance.
  Property owner James Whitman said he was unaware that local youth had been using
  the facility.


  "I''ve been meaning to have that equipment removed for years," Whitman said. "Sometimes
  I''d drive by and hear music coming from up there, but I figured it was just kids
  fooling around."


  Sussex County officials have sealed the site pending investigation. The remaining
  surveillance equipment has been removed by state technicians, though officials declined
  to specify which agency requested the equipment.


  Parents of the hospitalized teens have reported that their children continue to
  speak in fragmented, rhythmic patterns even under sedation. Dr. Hayes said the hospital
  is consulting with specialists in both psychiatric disorders and electronic interference
  effects.


  "We''re dealing with something unprecedented," Hayes said. "The patients seem to
  be experiencing shared delusions about consciousness preservation and system vulnerabilities.
  It''s as if they believe they discovered some kind of technology for recovering
  lost awareness."


  The band''s equipment remains in police custody. Deputy Santos noted that several
  tape recordings made at the site contain "anomalous audio patterns" that are being
  analyzed by state forensic specialists.


  Local residents report increased electronic interference in the Sparta Mountain
  area since the incident, with some describing voices emerging from radio static
  during the early morning hours.


  The investigation continues. Anyone with information about unusual electronic phenomena
  in the Sparta Mountain area is asked to contact the Sussex County Sheriff''s Office.'
