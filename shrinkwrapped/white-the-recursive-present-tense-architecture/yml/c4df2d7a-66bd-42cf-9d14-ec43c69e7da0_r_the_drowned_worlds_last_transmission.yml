excerpts:
- The entropy gradient had been accelerating for seventeen days when Meridian first
  detected the signal bleeding through from what the cartographers still insisted
  on calling Sector 7-G, though by then the very notion of sectors had become as obsolete
  as the Dewey Decimal System or the belief that information could be contained, catalogued,
  controlled. She was stationed at Listening Post Omega-9, one of those concrete bunkers
  that dotted the drowned coastlines like modernist tombstones, each one equipped
  with the kind of surveillance apparatus that would have made the Stasi weep with
  envy, if the Stasi hadn't been dissolved along with most other acronymic entities
  when the waters rose and the old certainties went under. The signal came in fragments,
  broken syllables riding the electromagnetic spectrum like refugees on a life raft,
  and Meridian—whose real name had been lost along with her personnel file in the
  Great Archive Purge of '02—found herself transcribing what sounded less like communication
  than like the death rattle of a civilization that had forgotten how to die properly.
- Meanwhile, three thousand miles away in what used to be called Nevada before the
  maps became unreliable, Dr. Cornelius Vetch was conducting his own form of archaeological
  excavation, though instead of digging down through layers of sediment and bone,
  he was drilling up through frequencies, searching for the ghost signals that haunted
  the abandoned broadcast towers. Vetch had been a professor of Information Theory
  at a university whose name he could no longer remember (the institution having been
  liquidated in one of those corporate restructurings that seemed to happen with the
  regularity of seasonal migrations), and he possessed that particular form of academic
  madness that comes from spending too many years trying to impose order on chaos.
  His equipment was a jury-rigged collection of vintage radio gear, quantum processors,
  and what appeared to be a modified prayer wheel—the last item being either a stroke
  of genius or evidence of his complete mental collapse, depending on your perspective
  regarding the intersection of technology and mysticism in the post-diluvian age.
