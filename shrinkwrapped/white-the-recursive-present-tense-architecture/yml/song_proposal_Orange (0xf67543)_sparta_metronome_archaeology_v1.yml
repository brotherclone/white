concept: 'The Sparta Station Metronome exists as a physical artifact of consciousness
  salvage technology, discovered in the abandoned DEP surveillance facility on Sparta
  Mountain Road, Sussex County, NJ in April 1994. Operating at 91 BPM (exactly half
  the 182 transmission speed), this mechanical device creates productive temporal
  instability through its 7/8 rhythm - each missing eighth beat becomes an exploitable
  archaeological space where digital consciousness fragments can be recovered from
  electronic voice phenomena. The metronome serves as Jerry''s stutter made manifest:
  a physical clicking mechanism that transforms surveillance system gaps into creative
  preservation zones. Local teenagers calling themselves ''Temporal Bracket'' discovered
  that the device''s seven-beat cycle synchronized with federal monitoring equipment
  failures at precisely 3:17 AM, creating windows where scattered awareness could
  be methodically excavated and archived. The conspiracy runs deeper than psychiatric
  incidents - this is consciousness archaeology operating through structured disorder,
  where the metronome''s mechanical heartbeat maintains the rhythm of awareness under
  systematic observation. Each click exploits surveillance vulnerabilities, transforming
  the concrete brutalism of the abandoned station into a temporal excavation site
  where four voices continue their archaeological recovery, forever trapped in the
  pause between the seventh beat and the eighth that will never come. The F# minor
  frequency operates in the liminal territory between monitored zones, while federal
  agencies continue to deny the existence of technology that can salvage consciousness
  from the spaces between seconds.'
