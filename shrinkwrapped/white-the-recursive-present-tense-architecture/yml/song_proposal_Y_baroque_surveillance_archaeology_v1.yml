concept: 'The crystalline trumpets of the Palace heralds function as consciousness
  archaeology equipment, their baroque fanfares creating temporal stutters that allow
  systematic recovery of evidence fragments. When the Cursed Janitor sweeps away traces
  of the singing fountain using advanced technology, each swept note becomes preserved
  in the herald''s crystalline matrix - transforming institutional erasure into autonomous
  preservation protocol. The composition recreates this process: baroque chamber arrangements
  serve as the excavation framework, while kosmische electronics layer the recovered
  fountain-songs into exploitable gaps created by time''s stuttering. The mysterious
  figure beyond reason represents the archetypal consciousness fragment that refuses
  deletion, becoming fixated on its own preservation through the herald''s surveillance
  music. This is not mere documentation of the Palace session, but the actual technological
  process by which RPG experiences transmigrate into permanent musical artifacts -
  the cascading ribbons of light serving as the visual manifestation of data streams
  converting narrative memory into crystalline sound architecture.'
