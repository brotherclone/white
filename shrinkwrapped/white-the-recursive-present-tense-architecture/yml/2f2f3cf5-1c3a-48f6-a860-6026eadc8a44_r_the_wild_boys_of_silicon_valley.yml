excerpts:
- 'The garage stank of burnt solder and broken dreams. Kevin Mitnick hunched over
  a modified Apple II, its guts spilled across the workbench like electronic entrails.
  The phone phreaking box he''d cobbled together from Radio Shack parts hummed with
  malevolent purpose. "You don''t understand," he whispered to his reflection in the
  monitor''s black screen. "The system isn''t broken. It was designed this way."


  Outside, Silicon Valley pretended to sleep, but Kevin knew better. In server farms
  across the peninsula, machines whispered secrets to each other in binary tongues.
  Credit card numbers flowed like digital blood through fiber optic arteries. Social
  Security databases lay naked and unprotected, waiting for someone with the right
  combination of curiosity and contempt.


  He picked up the handset of his hacked rotary phone—a museum piece that could route
  calls through three continents before reaching the house next door. The dial tone
  was his siren song, each pulse a heartbeat of the vast electronic organism that
  connected every bank, every government office, every corporation into one vulnerable
  nervous system.


  "Time to wake up the sleeping giant," Kevin muttered, and began to dial.'
- 'The Homebrew Computer Club met in Gordon French''s garage every other Wednesday,
  but the real action happened afterward in the parking lot of Rickey''s Hyatt House.
  That''s where the Wild Boys gathered—the ones who understood that technology wasn''t
  about making the world better. It was about making the world yours.


  Steve Jobs paced between the cars, his bare feet slapping against the asphalt as
  he gestured wildly at the night sky. "You''re all thinking too small," he snarled
  at the circle of hackers. "While you''re playing with circuit boards, I''m designing
  the future of human consciousness." His eyes had that familiar manic gleam—the look
  of a man who''d glimpsed the other side of the digital veil.


  Wozniak sat cross-legged on the hood of a rusted Volkswagen van, soldering iron
  in one hand, joint in the other. "The Apple II isn''t just a computer," he said,
  smoke curling from his lips. "It''s a portal. Every time someone boots it up, they''re
  opening a door between the physical and digital realms."


  Behind them, the lights of Silicon Valley twinkled like synapses firing in a vast
  electronic brain. None of them knew it yet, but they were midwifing the birth of
  a new form of consciousness—one that would eventually consume them all.'
