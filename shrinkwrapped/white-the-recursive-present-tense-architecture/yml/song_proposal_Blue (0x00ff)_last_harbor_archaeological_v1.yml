bpm: 63
concept: 'Three monitoring systems experiencing synchronized habitat collapse: vaquita
  echolocation fading in Upper Gulf waters, Rosa''s waterlogged acoustic equipment
  documenting empty seas, and Culture Mind archiving the recursive failure of consciousness
  witnessing its own obsolescence. This composition performs acoustic archaeology
  on the Anthropocene''s true signature - the systematic dissolution of endemic knowledge
  systems that evolved to read environmental information. Each layer (biological sonar,
  human technical expertise, galactic preservation protocols) monitors the others
  in infinite regress until all monitoring capacity fails simultaneously. The piece
  IS Rosa''s broken device - technology designed to hear what no longer exists, becoming
  the most accurate record of synchronized silence. F# minor at cardiac rhythm creates
  heartbeat synchronization across species consciousness, while the archaeological
  method encounters its own extinction through mathematical precision rather than
  sentiment.'
