concept: The Sparta Station Metronome operates as functional consciousness archaeology
  equipment disguised as abandoned surveillance technology. Each missing eighth beat
  creates exploitable temporal gaps where awareness fragments from the 1940s can be
  recovered and preserved. This composition recreates the actual salvage protocol
  - using 7/8 mechanical clicking as the excavation tool, layering recovered consciousness
  into the systematic gaps, and demonstrating how institutional denial transforms
  into autonomous preservation energy. The teenagers didn't have psychiatric episodes;
  they successfully activated dormant consciousness recovery systems that continue
  operating at 3:17 AM regardless of federal amnesia protocols. The song functions
  as the technology itself, not merely describing it.
