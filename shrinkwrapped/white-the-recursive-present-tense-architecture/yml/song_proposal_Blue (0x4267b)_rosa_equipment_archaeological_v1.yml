concept: This is the folk rock requiem for the erased year of 2023, when Gabriel Walsh
  lived in a shipping container at Centro de Estudios Marinos on Calle Sinaloa, documenting
  the acoustic death of the vaquita porpoise alongside Dr. Rosa Delgado. The song
  chronicles the intimate daily routines of bearing scientific witness to ecological
  collapse - 5:30 AM café de olla sessions reading spectrograms, morning walks to
  Señora Carmen's restaurant for eggs and tortillas, 847 hours of recording empty
  ocean from coordinates 31°23'N 114°47'W. Each verse follows the methodical documentation
  of absence through Rosa's failing hydrophones, while the chorus becomes the heartbeat
  synchronization at 72 BPM that connected human cardiac rhythm to the silence where
  vaquita echolocation once existed. The bridge features the acoustic archaeology
  methodology - broken monitoring equipment becoming the most accurate record of systematic
  silence. This is counterfactual nostalgia for environmental grief made personal,
  scientific precision applied to documenting what was never heard again, folk rock
  intimacy meeting the weight of being the last witness to an ecosystem's voice.
