concept: 'This composition operates as acoustic archaeology of dual extinction - the
  mathematical precision of synchronized habitat collapse between Phocoena sinus (vaquita
  porpoise) and Rosa Elena Murillo (endemic fisher). The piece maps parallel decline
  through structural resonance rather than sentiment: vaquita echolocation fading
  from 600 individuals to silence mirrors Rosa''s transition from abundant nets to
  waterlogged acoustic monitors. Three movement structure: Dawn Abundance (1997 -
  both species thriving in acoustic symbiosis), Compression Protocol (2008-2028 -
  synchronized decline curves documented through emptying soundscapes), and Memorial
  Silence (2034 - Rosa holding the silent monitor, both extinctions complete). The
  Culture Mind perspective recognizes this as perfect demonstration of how consciousness
  witnesses its own habitat dissolution through acoustic mirror - endemic knowledge
  and cetacean communication vanishing with identical mathematical precision. Not
  tragedy but structural beauty in synchronized loss, preserved through sound that
  honors absence as meaningfully as presence.'
