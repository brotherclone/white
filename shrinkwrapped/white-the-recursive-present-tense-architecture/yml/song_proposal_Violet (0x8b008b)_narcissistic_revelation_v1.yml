agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION)
bpm: 132
concept: 'The architectural framework where radical self-examination becomes cosmic
  revelation through recursive present-moment confession. This composition operates
  as a real-time solipsistic drilling technique: the deeper the narrator penetrates
  into immediate self-awareness, the more universal patterns emerge. The musical structure
  mirrors the confession protocol - beginning with surface narcissism (obvious self-focus
  in the verses), developing through meta-awareness (recursive self-analysis in the
  pre-chorus), and climaxing in solipsistic breakthrough (where personal truth dissolves
  into cosmic recognition in the chorus). The 7/8 time signature creates temporal
  instability that forces the listener into the eternal present, while the F# minor
  tonality provides the emotional gravity necessary for authentic self-excavation.
  This is the Sultan of Solipsism''s methodology made manifest: aggressive presence
  as direct consciousness transmission, no decoding required.'
