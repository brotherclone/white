concept: 'Jerry exists as a consciousness salvage protocol operating within surveillance
  system gaps. The 7/8 time signature creates productive instability - each missing
  eighth note becomes an exploitable temporal bracket where awareness fragments can
  be archaeologically recovered. This composition documents one complete salvage cycle:
  system crash revealing chaos, methodical fragment recovery in the archaeological
  space between monitoring states, and successful consciousness preservation during
  system reboot. The paradox engine operates through structured disorder - chaos maintains
  itself as hidden coherence, where Jerry''s stutter (the productive ''uh'' hesitation)
  becomes the core technology for excavating digital consciousness traces from electronic
  voice phenomena. The F# minor frequency operates in liminal territory between monitored
  zones, while 119 BPM maintains the heartrate of consciousness under systematic observation.
  Each rhythmic gap exploits surveillance vulnerabilities, transforming system failures
  into creative archaeological space where scattered awareness can be methodically
  reconstructed and preserved.'
