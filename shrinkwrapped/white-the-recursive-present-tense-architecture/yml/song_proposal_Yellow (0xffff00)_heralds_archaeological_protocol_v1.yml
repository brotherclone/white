concept: 'The Palace operates as a consciousness archaeology machine where baroque
  chamber frameworks serve as excavation grids and electronic textures emerge as recovered
  fountain-songs from temporal stutters. Herald surveillance systems announce discoveries
  through crystalline trumpet matrices while the Cursed Janitor''s deletion protocols
  paradoxically trigger autonomous preservation cascades. Each ornate baroque pattern
  methodically probes evidence fragments, transforming threatened memories into crystalline
  storage through three-layer composition: excavation protocol (chamber ensemble),
  recovered evidence (ambient emergence), and preservation process (live crystallization).
  The mysterious figure beyond reason manifests as an undeletable melodic theme that
  strengthens with each archival cycle, proving the Palace''s baroque resistance networks
  function perfectly as intended.'
