excerpts:
- 'The morning I discovered that my childhood friend Sarah had never existed was the
  morning I began to understand the true nature of memory''s betrayal. I stood in
  my mother''s kitchen, holding a photograph from my eighth birthday party—twenty-three
  children arranged in careful rows, their faces bright with cake-sugar grins. I could
  name each one, recall their favorite games, their pet hamsters, their parents''
  occupations. All except Sarah, who should have been there beside me in her yellow
  dress with the torn pocket, but whose absence left no gap in the composition, no
  awkward space where someone had been carefully excised.


  "There was never any Sarah," my mother said gently, as if she were explaining why
  we couldn''t keep the stray cat I''d found. "You used to talk to her all the time,
  though. We thought it was charming."


  But I remembered her so clearly: the way she hummed off-key while we built elaborate
  cities in my sandbox, how she always chose the broken crayon from the box, her peculiar
  habit of eating sandwiches from the corners inward. These memories felt as solid
  as the floorboards beneath my feet, as real as the ache in my chest that was spreading
  like spilled ink through water.'
- 'Dr. Henley''s office smelled of old leather and disappointment. The books that
  lined his walls seemed to lean inward, as if they were listening to our conversation,
  taking notes. He had the sort of face that suggested he''d spent years practicing
  expressions of professional concern in mirrors, and when he spoke about "reconstructed
  memories" and "childhood coping mechanisms," his words felt rehearsed, like lines
  from a play I hadn''t auditioned for.


  "The mind," he explained, folding his hands in a gesture that was meant to be reassuring,
  "is remarkably creative when it comes to filling gaps. What you remember as Sarah
  was likely a composite—bits and pieces of other children, perhaps, or aspects of
  yourself that you needed to externalize."


  I wanted to tell him about the scar on Sarah''s knee from when she fell off my bicycle,
  about how she cried during thunderstorms, about the way she always knew when I was
  lying. Instead, I nodded and made appropriate sounds of understanding while something
  inside me quietly began to unravel. If Sarah wasn''t real, what else might be suspect?
  Which of my certainties were built on foundations of sand?'
