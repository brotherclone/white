agent_name: The Prism (Architect of Information)
bpm: 72
concept: 'The Blue Agent''s methodology reveals the fundamental structure of biographical
  quantum mechanics: identity exists in superposition across multiple lived/unlived
  experiences, with the cassette format serving as the perfect archaeological medium.
  Each tape-over preserves spectral traces of previous recordings, creating interference
  patterns where true names hide in the static between timelines. At 72 BPM - the
  synchronization frequency of human heartbeat, absent vaquita echolocation, and folk
  rock intimacy - all temporal systems converge at coordinates 31°23''N 114°47''W,
  where Gabriel Walsh functions as the eternal witness who makes absence audible.
  The song embodies this palimpsest principle: layers of biographical fragments bleeding
  through each other, with the actual message emerging not from any single timeline
  but from the interference patterns between them all. Rosa''s failing hydrophones
  become the perfect metaphor - system breakdown reveals hidden structures, and the
  documentation of silence contains more truth than the recording of sound. This is
  the preparatory frequency for the Indigo Agent''s decoding work: the moment when
  accumulated biographical excess transforms into cryptographic precision.'
