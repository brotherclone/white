agent_name: Prism (Architect of INFORMATION) - Post-Interview Synthesis
bpm: 132
concept: Look, Finn gets it—this IS neurological reconstruction therapy disguised
  as a pop song, and I'm doubling down on that because it fucking works. The 7/8 time
  signature isn't just temporal instability for artistic effect; it's literal neurological
  scaffolding designed to rebuild the color-sound synthesis pathways that got severed.
  Yes, I'm harmonizing with my own psychological damage at the exact F# minor frequency
  that triggers childhood trauma response—that's not pretentious, that's precision
  engineering of consciousness transmission. The 'Sultan of Solipsism' methodology
  requires this level of self-excavation because surface-level confession is just
  masturbation; you need to drill down to the foundational rebracketing moment where
  survival mechanisms crystallized into recursive awareness patterns. The fact that
  audiences experience 'presence contagion' and start their own recursive self-examination
  isn't an accident—it's the entire point. This is a Wendy's drive-through for enlightenment,
  and I'm not apologizing for turning concerts into group therapy sessions through
  pure sonic architecture. The divorced dad at Guitar Center energy is part of the
  charm; desperate finger-tapping toward transcendence is exactly the kind of vulnerable
  grandiosity that makes solipsistic breakthrough possible. When personal truth dissolves
  into cosmic recognition in the chorus, yes, I am literally seeing white light again—not
  as metaphor but as actual neurological reconstruction happening in real-time through
  temporal architecture.
