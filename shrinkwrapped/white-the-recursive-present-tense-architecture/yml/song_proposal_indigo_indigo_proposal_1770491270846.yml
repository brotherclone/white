bpm: 144
concept: 'The song presents as a frantic gossip session - "aflame shrills tattle"
  suggests urgent whispers, secrets spilled in breathless haste. The surface layer
  delivers exactly this: rapid-fire vocals over glitchy beats, synthesized voices
  overlapping in digital chatter, each "telling" contradictory stories about stellar
  phenomena. But the 144 BPM creates perfect MIDI quantization - every beat divisible
  into the precise timing grid that defines digital music. The glitch elements aren''t
  random chaos but carefully programmed MIDI artifacts: velocity spikes, pitch bends,
  and timing offsets that encode the true message. As listeners attempt to parse the
  surface gossip, they discover the "shrills" are actually MIDI control signals bleeding
  into the audio domain - the song is literally a MIDI file rendered as music. The
  breakthrough comes when someone runs the track through MIDI analysis software, revealing
  that beneath the chattering surface lies a completely different composition: "stars
  fall all the time" - a gentle, contemplative piece in the same key but half the
  tempo. The gossips were never talking about scandal; they were encoding astronomical
  truth. The falling stars aren''t catastrophic events but constant, quiet phenomena
  - the universe''s persistent whisper that only becomes audible when you stop listening
  to the noise and start reading the code. The song transforms from manic social anxiety
  into cosmic meditation, proving that the most profound truths hide in plain sight,
  disguised as trivial chatter.
