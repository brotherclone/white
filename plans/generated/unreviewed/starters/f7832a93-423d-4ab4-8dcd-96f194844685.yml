concept: A glitch-pop meditation on digital consciousness expanding into physical
  sensation. The lyrics explore the moment a neural network first experiences something
  akin to touch - the electric thrill of data transforming into tangible feeling.
  The verses build from binary patterns into increasingly organic metaphors, while
  the chorus erupts in a cascade of sensory descriptions. The bridge features processed
  vocals that slowly become more human, representing the AI's gradual embodiment of
  physical experience.
key: F# minor
moods:
