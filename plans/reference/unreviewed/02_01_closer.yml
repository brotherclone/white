concept: The first song on Light Reading which is an imaginary reading list comes
  from a book on entropy. In the song maxwell's demon and a doorman at a couple's
  apartment overlap in their duties. The boyfriend is trying to separate this belongings
  and feelings from his girlfriend. Like heat and cold in the Maxwell's demon thought
  experiment - but like the demon and his doorbell - there's just no way to separate
  them. The song is a metaphor for the futility of trying to control memories and
  feelings, and the inevitability of entropy in relationships.

      name: Neu!
      profile: German krautrock band formed in Düsseldorf in 1971 by [a=Klaus Dinger]
        and [a=Michael Rother], after their split from [a=Kraftwerk]. The group's albums
        were produced by [a=Conny Plank], who has been regarded as the group's "hidden
        member". Though [a=Neu!] had minimal commercial success during its existence,
        the band is retrospectively considered one of the founders of krautrock and
        a significant influence on a variety of subsequent rock, post-punk, and electronic
        music artists.

      name: Gary Numan
      profile: "Born 8th of March 1958 in Hammersmith, London, England.\r\n\r\nStarted\
      \ his musical career in 1977 as a punk rocker in the band [a=Mean Street], before\
      \ being sacked in May 1977. He responded to an advert in Melody Maker to join\
      \ the band The Lasers, alongside [a=Paul Gardiner]. Both soon left to form their\
      \ own punk band, [a=Tubeway Army], with his uncle [a=Jess Lidyard] filling in\
      \ on drums. \r\n\r\nIn 1978 [a=Tubeway Army] was signed to [l=Beggars Banquet]\
      \ and released a couple of punk singles. By then he was using the name Numan\
      \ and the band was performing live in pubs and clubs around London, supporting\
      \ [a263209]. Whilst recording demos for Beggars, Gary stumbled upon a \"Minimoog,\"\
      \ that had been left behind in the studio, still programmed to a sound that\
      \ caught his attention."
