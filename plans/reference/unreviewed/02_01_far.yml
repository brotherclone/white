concept: The first song on Light Reading which is an imaginary reading list comes
  from a book on entropy. In the song maxwell's demon and a doorman at a couple's
  apartment overlap in their duties. The boyfriend is trying to separate this belongings
  and feelings from his girlfriend. Like heat and cold in the Maxwell's demon thought
  experiment - but like the demon and his doorbell - there's just no way to separate
  them. The song is a metaphor for the futility of trying to control memories and
  feelings, and the inevitability of entropy in relationships.

      name: Neu!
      profile: German krautrock band formed in Düsseldorf in 1971 by [a=Klaus Dinger]
        and [a=Michael Rother], after their split from [a=Kraftwerk]. The group's albums
        were produced by [a=Conny Plank], who has been regarded as the group's "hidden
        member". Though [a=Neu!] had minimal commercial success during its existence,
        the band is retrospectively considered one of the founders of krautrock and
        a significant influence on a variety of subsequent rock, post-punk, and electronic
        music artists.
