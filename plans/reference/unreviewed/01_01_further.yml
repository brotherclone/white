concept: The song takes place in a vaudeville theater where a spiritualist has tried
  to levitate but the trick has gone wrong. He now hangs high in the air and his thin
  thread is fraying. He watches as the audience revolts when the illusion is shattered.
  This is the first song on the 'black' album which our protagonist are struggling
  to find a way to survive in world where the magic has suddenly shut off. They yearns
  for their connection to a higher plane and purpose.

    name: Great White
    profile: "Hair / Glam Metal (Heavy Metal) & Hard Rock band from Los Angeles, California\
      \ (USA). \r\n\r\nGreat White formed in 1977. The band gained popularity during\
      \ the 1980's and early 1990's. In 2003, the band made headlines when The Station\
      \ nightclub fire led to the deaths of 100 people in West Warwick, Rhode Island,\
      \ including Ty Longley, who had been a member of lead singer [a255625]'s solo\
      \ band. In 2011 the band split, with Jack Russell forming \"Jack Russell's Great\
      \ White\" and lead singer [a2590929] (of [a408910]) fronting Great White.\r\n\
