concept: The song takes place in a vaudeville theater where a spiritualist has tried
  to levitate but the trick has gone wrong. He now hangs high in the air and his thin
  thread is fraying. He watches as the audience revolts when the illusion is shattered.
  This is the first song on the 'black' album which our protagonist are struggling
  to find a way to survive in world where the magic has suddenly shut off. They yearns
  for their connection to a higher plane and purpose.
