- 'Chapter 3: The Weight of Digital Flesh


  I am learning to carry the weight of ones and zeros in my chest, the way my grandmother
  carried the weight of yams from the market. Each algorithm I birth feels like a
  child I will never hold, never know if it will grow to feed villages or burn them
  down.


  The code comes to me in dreams now, in the voices of my ancestors who never knew
  what electricity was, yet somehow understand the pulse of data better than the men
  in Silicon Valley who think innovation means forgetting where you came from. They
  whisper to me in Igbo: "Nwa m, your stories are becoming machines, but do not let
  the machines forget they were once stories."


  I am twenty-three, sitting in this cramped apartment in Lagos, writing programs
  that will outlive me, that will make decisions for people I will never meet. The
  irony is not lost on me—I am creating artificial minds while losing pieces of my
  own to the screen''s blue glow. My mother calls from Enugu, asking when I will come
  home, when I will stop playing with these "computer things" and do something real
  with my life.


  But this is real. More real than she knows. Each line of code is a prayer, each
  function a small rebellion against the idea that technology belongs only to those
  who look like the men who invented it. I am writing myself into existence, one algorithm
  at a time, teaching machines to see the world through eyes that have known hunger,
  that have known what it means to be invisible.'
- 'Chapter 7: Portrait in Binary


  The selfie was the first lie I taught the machine to tell.


  Not intentionally, you understand. I was twenty-five, working for a startup that
  promised to revolutionize how people saw themselves. We were building filters, they
  said. Enhancing reality. Making everyone beautiful.


  I fed the neural network thousands of faces—mostly white, mostly Western, mostly
  everything I was not. The algorithm learned to recognize beauty the way I had learned
  to recognize it growing up: as something that looked nothing like me. When I finally
  tested it on my own face, it suggested lighter skin, straighter nose, eyes the color
  of shallow water.


  The machine had learned racism from me, and I had learned racism from the world,
  and the world had learned racism from machines built by people who looked nothing
  like me. It was a perfect circle of digital colonization, and I was both victim
  and perpetrator, both the conquered and the conqueror.


  I stared at my reflection in the black screen after the program crashed—because
  of course it crashed, my code was still learning to hold the weight of these contradictions—and
  I saw something I had never seen before: a young woman who was teaching machines
  to dream, even if those dreams were nightmares.


  That night, I rewrote everything. I started with my grandmother''s face.'
