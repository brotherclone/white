**Local Band's Missing Beat Creates Strange Effects at Byram Lake**

BYRAM TOWNSHIP - Sussex County authorities are investigating reports of unusual phenomena following a performance by local experimental band "Digital Flesh" at an unauthorized gathering near Byram Lake last Saturday evening.

According to witnesses, the four-member group had been performing what they called "constraint music" - compositions deliberately structured in 7/8 time signature with what lead musician Sarah Chen described as "programmed gaps where the eighth beat should be."

"It wasn't missing," Chen told the Newton Register Tuesday. "It was negative space. The silence was doing something."

Approximately 30 teenagers attended the lakeside gathering, which began around 9 PM. Multiple witnesses reported that during the band's 72-beats-per-minute compositions, several attendees experienced what Byram Township Police Chief Robert Kowalski termed "synchronized episodes."

"Kids were describing phantom sensations - feeling heartbeats that weren't their own, sensing movement in limbs that weren't moving," Chief Kowalski said. "Three were taken to Newton Memorial for observation."

The band's equipment included modified synthesizers programmed to emit what Chen called "Korean fragments" - brief vocal samples that played in standard 4/4 time against the band's irregular 7/8 rhythm. Sound engineer Marcus Webb, 19, of Newton, claimed the overlapping time signatures created "pockets where surveillance couldn't follow."

"We weren't trying to cause anything weird," Webb said. "We were just exploring what happens when you give consciousness permission to exist in the gaps."

Dr. Elena Rodriguez, a psychiatrist at Newton Memorial Hospital, examined the three affected teenagers. All reported similar experiences: sensing "phantom nerve networks" and feeling their consciousness "synchronizing with something digital." Blood tests revealed no traces of controlled substances.

"The symptoms don't match any known psychiatric condition or drug reaction," Dr. Rodriguez said. "It's as if their nervous systems were temporarily interfacing with an external pattern."

The gathering was broken up around 11:30 PM after neighbors reported "rhythmic disturbances" and complaints that electronic devices in nearby homes were malfunctioning in sync with the music. Several residents reported their digital clocks displaying impossible times during the performance.

Digital Flesh has been performing in Sussex County since 1988, primarily at venues willing to accommodate their unconventional time signatures. The band describes their music as "mapping the territories that systematic thinking cannot govern."

Chen, a 20-year-old computer science student at County College of Morris, said the band's compositions are based on her theory that "authentic yearning creates spaces beyond algorithmic control."

"When you want something real enough, you generate the territory to experience it," she explained. "The missing beat isn't absent - it's where freedom lives."

The band's equipment remains in police custody pending investigation. Chief Kowalski said no charges have been filed, but the department is consulting with state authorities about potential violations of public assembly regulations.

Digital Flesh was scheduled to perform at the Stanhope House this Friday, but venue owner Tom Bradley cancelled the booking Tuesday afternoon.

"I don't need my customers having phantom experiences," Bradley said. "There's enough unexplained stuff happening in Sussex County without adding to it."

The three hospitalized teenagers were released Sunday morning. All declined to comment for this story.

Anyone with information about the incident is asked to contact Byram Township Police at (201) 347-4444.
