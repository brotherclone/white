  The patient sits before me, fingers trembling not from withdrawal but from the peculiar
  anxiety of disconnection. "Doctor," she says, "I can''t remember who I was before
  the screen." This is not metaphor—this is the literal amnesia of digital dissociation,
  a syndrome I first documented in 1957 when the early computer terminals began appearing
  in research hospitals.


  The human psyche, evolved over millennia to recognize faces in firelight and voices
  across valleys, now confronts an environment of pure abstraction. We mistake the
  phosphorescent glow of cathode rays for illumination, but it is a cold light that
  casts no shadows, creates no depth. The patient''s pupils dilate not in response
  to darkness but to the infinite recession of electronic space.


  Consider the paradox: we seek connection through devices that fundamentally isolate.
  Each terminal is a confessional booth where the priest is absent, replaced by the
  mechanical ear of magnetic tape and the blind eye of the vacuum tube. The patient
  speaks to no one and everyone simultaneously, achieving a communion that is both
  perfect and utterly hollow.


  "Tell me about your dreams," I ask, and she describes visions of endless corridors
  lined with blinking lights, each one a message she cannot read, a voice she cannot
  answer. This is the topology of digital consciousness—not the warm chambers of human
  memory, but the cold geometries of circuit boards.'
- "Chapter VII: Protocol as Pathology  \nPage 5\n\nThe engineers speak of \"handshakes\"\
  \ between machines, a grotesque anthropomorphization that reveals their deep misunderstanding\
  \ of human connection. A handshake requires flesh, warmth, the subtle pressure that\
  \ communicates trust or wariness. What passes between terminals is merely the exchange\
  \ of electrical states—on or off, one or zero, a binary reduction of the infinite\
  \ complexity of human greeting.\n\nMy colleague Dr. Hartmann observed patients in\
  \ the early SAGE installations, those massive defense computers that promised to\
  \ protect us from aerial attack. Instead, they attacked something far more fundamental—the\
  \ operators' sense of embodied reality. After months of staring into radar screens,\
  \ translating the movement of aircraft into abstract blips of light, these men began\
  \ to lose their proprioceptive awareness. They could no longer locate themselves\
  \ in space without the mediation of electronic display.\n\n\"The screen becomes\
  \ more real than reality,\" one operator confided to me. \"I dream in green phosphor\
  \ now.\" This is the essence of what I term Protocol Syndrome—the gradual replacement\
  \ of human intuition with algorithmic procedure, the substitution of lived experience\
  \ with processed data.\n\nThe patient learns to communicate not through the subtle\
  \ dance of gesture and intonation that has served our species for millennia, but\
  \ through the rigid syntax of machine language. Each interaction must be parsed,\
  \ validated, acknowledged. Error messages replace the gentle correction of misunderstanding.\
  \ Connection timeouts substitute for the natural ebb and flow of conversation."
